He said, "But nobody has ever asked before."
I said, "But I'm asking."
And billions of dollars will come in, and we're protecting a great ally.
We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things.
But we said, "You're very wealthy.
You have to pay," and they're going to pay.
And that's true with many countries by the way.
That's true with many countries.
They never respected us.
They could never believe it.
I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan.
I said to Prime Minister, I said, "How did you get away with this for so long?"
And he looked at me and he couldn't really answer it because how the hell did this happen?
We're protecting 94 countries.
Ask China, "How many countries are you protecting President Xi?"
And they look at me like, "What a stupid question.
We protect one.
China."
You ask President Putin, "How many countries are you protecting President Putin?"
And he looks and he goes, "Russia."
You ask other countries … we're protecting at least 94.
In fact, so many they can't even tell me.
I've been trying to get an answer for four months.
So many they can't even tell.
It's crazy, but it's all beautiful the way it's happening.
A lot of good things are happening.
But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay.
Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it.
But I don't like that.
I don't like that.
The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office.
That was quite a day.
After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation.
We are finally putting America first.
Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests.
It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world.
Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood.
Not one drop.
Actually, I have to be honest.
One soldier stepped on a nail.
That's true.
I said, "Don't tell the press that because they'll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail."
I said, "How bad was it?"
"It's okay."
I said, "Don't mention it please."
They always like to mention exactly what happened.
You can take it a little bit low key.
Stepped on a nail.
Not a drop of blood.
And we don't have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria.
They've been fighting for 1000 years.
But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don't mind.
We kept the oil.
We kept the oil.
And we'll distribute that oil, we'll help out the Kurds, and we'll help out other people.
We'll also help out ourselves if that's okay.
Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones.
Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions.
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here.
We don't want to do that.
To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures.
Toughest ever that we've ever had.
No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats.
They want open borders, which mean crime.
They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death.
After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels.
Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities.
We are now building a wall.
We're building it.
We're building it.
And you think that was easy?
The Democrats, they didn't want that wall.
I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents.
Not 25 cents.
But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there.
Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases.
We're winning cases now.
Winning a lot of cases.
But the wall is going up rapidly.
It's going up rapidly.
And this is a very serious wall.
This is the exact everything they wanted.
I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE.
Incredible people, tough people.
They love our country.
And I said, "Give me the specifications for the wall."
They said, "Well sir, we'd like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar."
I said, "Well, what do you want?
Which one?"
So I did all three because it's a different form of cutting.
You can cut through steel, but you can't through the concrete and then you can't through the hardened rebar.
We got it all.
"And we also need see-through, sir.
Got to see who's on the other side."
That makes sense, right?
Not just concrete.
It's more expensive what we're doing, but we're giving and we're building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year.
It's going up fast.
In all the right areas.
In all the right areas.
That was a tough one.
And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out.
They're great.
Great people.
We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country.
And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border.
And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it's never been before.
And I want to thank the country of Mexico.
They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders.
27,000.
You know what that is?
And they are keeping people out.
And I want to thank the President of Mexico.
He's an excellent person, great man.
And we appreciate it.
And the reason is that our Democrats won't even approve things called loopholes.
They're loopholes.
That's a horrible name, right?
That means it's a loophole.
That means you can come in illegally and lots of things.
Catch and release.
You catch them.
Then you've got to release them.
By law you've got to release them or they'll arrest the border patrol agent if they don't release.
It's crazy.
But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don't want to do it.
They don't want to do it.
They're obstructionists.
They're colluders.
And we can't let it happen.
That's why you have to go with Tate Reeves.
Tate's going to send a big signal, by the way.
It's a big signal.
It's great for you.
He's going to be a great governor.
It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats.
It's very important that Tate wins.
Very important.
We're also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, "We're not going to have them," and Roger Wicker said, "We're not going to have them.
And Cindy said, "We're not going to have them."
Democrats' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets.
If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn't want their job.
MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging.
You never saw anything like it.
I'll say, "You know what?
Better you than me."
Let's see who would do good.
He'd do good.
That guy.
That guy would do good.
Most of you wouldn't do too good.
No.
I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country.
Who would do it?
They're moving thousands of people from MS-13.
These gangs are the worst people.
These people, these are not human beings.
You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, "How dare you say they're not human?"
You ever see these people?
And they slice people up with a knife because it's more painful than using a gun.
And then I have to defend myself when I say they're animals.
But you know what?
I never changed.
I didn't say, "Oh, I'd like to apologize.
I'd like to apologize.
Crazy Nancy."
And you got to look at her district in San Francisco.
She's spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff.
Take a look at what's happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco.
It's thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods.
Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy.
Go home and fix your district.
Go home and fix your district.
If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves.
Tuesday.
Got to get out.
You got to get out.
Got to send the signal.
Let it be a big victory too.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love New Jersey and I'm thrilled to be back right here in the Garden State.
Thank you.
The Garden State.
Together we're achieving historic victories for New Jersey families.
You see it every single day.
The New Jersey unemployment rate has reached the lowest of all time.
More people are working today in the state of New Jersey than ever before.
I have to tell you more people, almost 160 million, are working right now in the United States.
That's the highest level of employment in the history of our country.
A lot of countries aren't doing so well, just so you understand.
Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history, with the incredible brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA.
A massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody.
Weeks ago we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs.
$250 billion coming in.
Oh that's going to be so nice.
We're restoring America's industrial might like never before.
They're all coming back.
They want to be where the action is.
After years of devastating defense cuts we have fully rebuilt the United States military.
Thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest warriors in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder, and leader, al-Baghdadi is dead.
Weeks ago, at my direction, the US military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani.
Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans, and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold.
Yet Washington Democrats, like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi, they opposed our action to save American lives.
They oppose it.
They oppose it.
You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly?
The legs, the arms, wiped out.
No legs, no arms.
Soleimani loved that.
That was his weapon of choice.
We didn't like him.
He's not around anymore.
Well we are creating jobs and killing terrorists the Congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades.
It's all they know how to do.
The do nothing Democrats.
They have spent the last three years, and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady, trying to overthrow the last election.
We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election.
We are going to have a victory that's even greater than 2016.
This November we are going to win back the House, we are going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep The White House.
The American people are disgusted by the Washington Democrat … You see it.
You see it.
Which is worse, the impeachment hoax or the witch hunts from Russia?
But we're going to be signing up millions and millions of registered Independents, Democrat voters.
Today I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected.
The best we've ever had.
Remember I used to go over polls?
But I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise I wouldn't.
We had our best polls.
Americans of all political beliefs are sick and tired of the radical rage filled left Socialists.
I never saw anything … What's going on in this country … What's going on in this country, really the Democrat party is the Socialist party and maybe worse.
Voters are making a mass exodus from that party and we are welcoming them to the Republican party with wide open arms.
The Republican party is doing great.
We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat party because he has had enough of their extremism, enough of their Socialism, and enough of their vile hoaxes and scams.
He's had enough.
I tell you he really is, he's a brave guy.
He just said, " I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.
It's a hoax, it's a scam, I'm not doing it."
We called him, "You're our kind of guy.
Let's go."
It didn't take much because he believes like we do.
We are truly honored to be here with the newest Republican member of the House of Representatives, your great congressman, Jeff Van Drew.
I have to tell you a few weeks ago Jeff was one of the few brave and principled Democrat lawmakers, in all fairness we've been after him for a longtime, who stood up to the House Democrats and the outrageous abusive power that you see going on right now.
They can't win an election so they're trying to steal an election.
It's not happening folks.
It's not happening.
Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party, and to stand tall in defense of our constitution, our freedom, and democracy itself.
I just want to … I have to tell you, I've gotten to know him really well over the last couple of weeks.
He's a great guy, he's a brave guy, he shares our values.
He supports lower taxes, not bad.
They want to raise your taxes.
How did that work Jeff?
How did you get elected with that one?
Less regulation, a strong national defense.
He loves our military, loves our vets, and police.
He is a tireless champion for the state of New Jersey.
He loves your second amendment, which is under siege by the Democrats.
Jeff, it's an honor to be with you.
Please, please.
Thank you.
Thank you man.
We have tens of thousands of people outside.
If anybody would like to give them your place please let us know, but we have thousands and thousands.
Tens of thousands.
Jeff gave me a number, he said, "175,000 people signed up."
Is that a fact?
175?
I think he's on his way.
I think he's on his way.
Thank you Jeff, great job.
Thank you Jeff.
Thank you Jeff.
It's been a little bit of a story.
You see the fakers back there?
Fake news.
Fake.
You know if another candidate has 1,000 people they say he spoke to a massive crowd.
If they have 10,000, like Pocahontas went into Central Park in New York.
This young men could have 10,000 people, you know that, in Central Park.
She had 10,000 people like in Central Park.
I said, "What's the big deal?"
They made it, "Oh the crowds are so large."
Jeff just told you he had 175,000 people sign up.
Seriously you have to see outside.
They know because they have to follow, they're trailers.
I call them trailers.
But they're fake.
They're fake.
They're not honest.
Let me just tell you, so here's the story, so we have these massive crowds that fill up stadiums every single time.
We have tens of thousands of people outside.
They never mention it.
They never mention it, so maybe they will tonight.
But that's an all-time record.
This is not a brand new place and unfortunately it holds 10,000 people or less.
We set the all-time record.
You know why?
Because for games … See the floor packed with people?
For games you're playing ice hockey or basketball, so we broke the all-time record in this house.
It's a wonderful house in a wonderful community.
Also in Wildwood, like we're in the middle of winter.
There is nobody in the middle of winter and it's a great place in the summer.
Those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane practically.
But on June 2nd everybody has to do us all a favor.
Number one you have to get out and vote Republican.
Get rid of these clowns.
You have to get out and vote for really a brave man.
What he did was incredible.
Jeff Van Drew, what he did was incredible.
Get out and vote.
He's going to have a big victory.
He's going to have a big victory.
We're grateful to have with us this evening some wonderful friends of mine, people that I've known forever, your former governor who did a terrific job, Chris Christie.
Chris.
Great Chris, great job.
Your wonderful Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt, what a job he's doing.
Thank you Doug.
Thank you Doug.
My campaign's two great New Jersey co-chairs and I think we'll play for the state … You know they all say Republicans can't win.
Tell me why?
They said, "Should you move this to the Meadowlands?"
I said, "No, I want to be in South Jersey.
We want to be with our friends."
But we could have filled up the Meadowlands arena two or three times.
Maybe we'll do it during the summer.
Should we do it during the summer?
Maybe.
But two brave guys, two great politicians.
People that love our state.
State senators Mike Testa and Joe Pennacchio.
Joe Pennacchio.
Thank you Joe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Two incredible New Jersey natives, you've never heard of Kellyanne Conway have you say something.
Thank you Kellyanne.
I just want to thank Republicans because what they've been doing is incredible.
Republican leadership in this country we're winning, winning, winning like never before.
We're winning again and we've got a party that's a very different part, a much stronger party, a much more inclusive party.
We have a party that we love.
We have a party that has the votes.
We have a party like they've never had before.
The Republican party respected again.
I have to say this, America is winning again and America is thriving again like never before.
Since the election we have created seven million new jobs.
The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration, listen to this one, in United States history.
That's a good fact, the lowest in history.
Thank you man.
We have a great veteran up here and he said, "We love you.
We love you."
The veterans.
Are we doing good for the veterans?
Thank you.
African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country.
Ever recorded!
Women's unemployment is at a 65 year low.
Sorry about that.
Soon it's going to be historic.
Another couple of good months it'll be historic.
65 years for women.
In the eight years before I took office over 300,000 working age people left the workforce.
They had no choice.
In just three years of my administration 3.5 million people have joined the workforce.
Nobody believes it, including the fake … The workforce.
Nobody believes it including the fake news.
If I would have said that during the campaign that we were going to produce numbers like this, the fakeness would have been hitting me.
He's exaggerating.
He's lying, Pinocchio, Pinocchio.
The press is very dishonest.
More than two million millennials have gotten jobs and their wages have grown by nearly 5% every year, which is a record.
A record number of Americans between the ages of 25 and 34 are now working, another record.
Under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the fastest gains of anybody.
You don't hear that because this is a blue collar boom.
It's very nice.
It's about time.
It's about time.
It's been many, many decades.
Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10%, first time ever.
Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased, listen to this, by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%.
Median household income is at an all time high.
For President Bush, in eight years it was $450, over eight years.
Think of this for a second.
Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years it was $975, so eight years, eight years, 450, 975 under your favorite President, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts that nobody's ever cut taxes like this.
Nobody's ever cut regulations.
That's why all these jobs are being built.
Under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000, and that's three years, and it's going up.
It's going up very substantial.
That's a big difference.
New business applications in New Jersey have just soared to a record high, and we have lifted 10 million people nationwide off federal welfare.
They're off.
They are off federal welfare.
Nobody would've believed these numbers.
Someday they're going to write the true story.
Our child tax credit alone is delivering $2,200 a year to 40 million American families.
We have ended, so importantly for you, the war on American energy.
The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
We don't need anybody else's energy anymore.
It's so nice.
What happened in the last three years with energy is incredible, but extreme liberals in Washington want to shut down U.S. energy, including through the so-called Green New Deal.
Close your factories.
Get rid of your cows.
You don't have too many cows in Wildwood, but if you do, they're gone.
We will never sacrifice America's energy independence.
Took us a long time to get there, and we really picked it up over the last three years.
What we've done is incredible, pipelines all over.
Pipelines are good.
They're underground, they're good, environmentally sound.
To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most.
These are the communities that really have suffered.
We created, with the help of a great gentleman from the state of South Carolina, You know who I'm talking about?
Tim Scott, right?
Senator Tim Scott, he's an incredible guy.
He really is.
He came to my office and he had this idea that he's wanted to do for a long time.
Senator Tim Scott, opportunity zones, and jobs and investment are now pouring into nearly 170 newly designated opportunity zones right here in New Jersey, all over the United States.
Billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and not government dollars, they're flowing into the opportunities zones into areas where investment was dead.
For decades, politicians ran for office promising to protect American workers, but then they went to Washington and they lined their pockets with special address cash, and they shipped American jobs and dreams to other countries.
They closed up your factories.
They got rid of your jobs.
They didn't have to pay taxes.
Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steal our farms and ransack our communities.
Not anymore, not anymore, because we are defenseless no more because long last you have a President who puts America first.
Is that okay?
The United States laws, listen to this number, and you know if it was wrong, the fake news would be all over me, and I've been saying it for three years.
The United States lost 60,000 factories and plants.
Think of that.
You wouldn't think that's possible because of stupid trade deals, because of bad leadership.
During the 16 years of the two prior administrations, under just three years, my administration has now added 12,000 new factories, and many more are being built and they're pouring back into the United States, because that's where the action is.
That's where they want to be.
They are pouring back into our country, new plants and factories.
You see them all over.
I passed two of them coming in, brand new, beautiful plants and factories.
They're pouring back in.
This is where the action is.
This is where they want to be.
I see the leaders, they say, "It's incredible what happened to your country."
I said, "Don't tell me that.
We want you to have your companies build plants in New Jersey and other places," and that's what's happening.
But on no issue have Washington Democrats thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration.
Left-wing, radical, politician support deadly sanctuary cities, and remember, a sanctuary city is a jurisdiction that refuses to hand over criminal aliens that are in local law enforcement custody.
Instead, they order them to be released into your community.
What the hell is going on?
What is going on?
Once set loose, these criminal aliens are free to continue their crimes spree against innocent Americans.
Right here in New Jersey, your state's Democrat leaders have instituted sanctuary policies that result in dangerous predators being set free into your community.
For example, Cumberland County, we all know Cumberland County very well, right?
Good luck with this one.
They released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of a child.
He is now at large, free to search for another innocent victim.
They didn't want to give him to ICE, and I want to thank ICE, because the abuse they take and the incredible job they do.
Right here, another criminal alien was arrested for a violent assault in New Jersey.
The sanctuary jurisdiction of Middlesex County defied the ICE request to detain him.
Local authorities released him and he went on to commit a gruesome triple murder.
I could read these cases, honestly, I could read and state these cases to you all night.
I could state these cases to you all night.
No American should ever be hurt, harmed or killed because left-wing politicians, Democrats, decided to shield and shelter… Look, look, wait.
You have criminals that are on the streets that should be in jail.
You have criminals that on the street that should be taken the hell out of our country and brought back to where they came from.
By the way, ICE has removed thousands upon thousands of MS-13 gang members, the most brutal people.
You don't want to do that job.
Maybe you do, a couple of tough people up there.
Anybody want to be with ICE?
You got a lot of tough people in New Jersey.
New Jersey is different.
I think New Jersey is different.
No, but these ICE people, they love our country.
They're proud and they're tough people, and they'll go right into a pack.
They call it a pack and they start swinging.
Everyone's swinging or they end up standing up.
That's the end of that, and you know what they do?
They bring the MS-13 and many other gang members and other members back to El Salvador, back to Honduras, back to Guatemala, back to Mexico.
I want to thank Mexico because you know what's happening, right?
Thousands and thousands at this moment, 27,000 soldiers from Mexico, protecting our Southern border.
I want to thank the President.
Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos.
Republicans stand for law, order and justice, and say what you want, but those are the facts.
We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members.
We are literally taking them by so many, thousands and thousands, and we're bringing him back.
Thanks to our tireless efforts of border patrol to secure our border, we have reduced illegal border crossings seven straight months in a row.
We have the numbers down by 75% since spring, 75%.
We have ended catch and release and really, look, I had another party.
I could get anything.
If I wanted to spend money on anything, look with the military, we got two trillion dollars, right?
More.
Two trillion, all made in America, right?
Everything.
Best planes, best missiles, best everything, made in America.
If I wanted to build anything, the only thing they put the whole weight of their party, they didn't want us to have the wall.
They knew it worked.
Many of them voted five years ago for a wall.
They just didn't know how to get it built.
I do.
But what happened is through a series of court cases and other things, the money has won, and we are now building that beautiful wall, and this powerful border wall is going up at record speed and we just reached over 100 miles of wall, and by next year, we'll be over 400 miles, and shortly thereafter it will be complete.
A lot of people were saying a year ago, "He didn't build the wall yet.
He didn't build the wall."
Let me tell you.
When you have the strength of a party that has the House, okay, hopefully they're not going to have the House for long.
We'll have a wonderful new speaker, will get rid of Nancy Pelosi, nervous Nancy, nervous Nancy.
We'll have Kevin McCarthy who's been fantastic.
We have to win back the House.
But think of this.
The wall, so many people were saying, "Build it."
Well, it's not easy when you have the weight of an entire party and they control the House, not easy.
We did it and frankly we were building the wall through the help of the military, the Army Corps of Engineers anyway, but you know what?
Now we actually have the money and it's going up very rapidly.
In all due respect to Mexico, we like Mexico very much, and we've gotten along great with Mexico, and the President's a friend of mine, and I think he's doing a fantastic job.
It's a tough situation.
But Mexico is in fact, you will soon find out, paying for the wall.
Okay?
They'd hit you with that.
Now the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico, and it's an advantage for Mexico, too, when you think about it.
The wall is a vital barrier for blocking deadly drugs from pouring into these communities.
What we're doing is stopping drugs at a record number.
It's still anything that comes over is too much, but we're blocking it at a record number.
I'm also very proud to report that we won a critical Supreme Court victory yesterday on immigration.
We will now be finally able to enforce federal law, and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer funded programs.
They were killing our country, killing our country.
Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are right now.
Frankly, they're crazy.
These people are crazy.
They're taking their cues from socialists like Bernie.
Left-wing lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of health care that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health care plans, which many people like.
The plans of every Democrat running for President would demolish the economy of New Jersey, where half a million new New Jersey workers are employed at some of the best and most innovative health care employment companies.
We have them working at the companies, and we have people getting great health care.
It's been so long.
It's finally working and they want to destroy it.
The Republican party will never let it happen.
We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care, take away your doctors, take away all of the good care that we fought, and we fought hard, and we're doing well and now we're doing better.
By the way, some time prior to the end of the year, we're putting in for a new middle income tax cut, a very big one.
But we're making health care better and much, much cheaper.
We've done a great job in running it and we've given you a lot of alternatives.
We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will, the Republican party, pre-existing conditions, we saved it.
We are stopping surprise medical billing and making everything transparent.
That's a big deal, and that will take effect starting in about two months from now.
Everything's transparent.
You'll be able to see pricing.
You'll be able to go and price other hospitals, other doctors.
It's going to be an incredible thing.
Nobody believes I was able to do it, but we did it.
We are defending your right to keep the doctor and the plan of your choice.
We are lowering drug prices.
The Democrats are increasing drug prices.
We are fighting the lobbyists and special interests.
We are serving you and how are we doing?
We're doing good, right?
But because of price transparency, we are getting it done.
We're approving more generic drugs than ever before in the history of our country.
That means they come in, frankly, they're just as good as the big names, but they sell for 80% less in some cases.
We are unleashing innovation to cure diseases of all kinds.
We are cutting out the rich middlemen and delivering prescription drugs directly to the consumers.
These are all things that we had to fight like hell to get.
We're making less paperwork for your doctors and giving you easy control of your medical records, which is a big deal for a lot of people.
We are prohibiting hospitals from hiding their prices and charging hidden costs.
You go home, you say, "Oh, I'm feeling better.
The doctor was fantastic," and then they send you a bill for $25,000.
That's the end of that.
All of a sudden the doctor wasn't so good, right?
We are making companies compete for your business.
We are repealing burdensome taxes.
We have accomplished more than any President in the first three years of their term by far, not even close.
We have provided health insurance options, 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we have historic investments in treating kidney disease, HIV, pediatric cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
We're making so much progress.
We have just passed a thing that I think is great.
I never understood.
For 45 years, they've been trying to get it passed.
We've just passed a thing called Right to Try.
You know what that is?
So, we have the greatest doctors, the greatest technicians, the greatest labs in the world, and we'll have a drug that's looking good, but it's going to take five more years, and by the way, we've brought the timing way down from 12 years to half of that, but it takes years to get it approved.
You have people that are terminally ill.
If they have money, they go to Asia, they go to Europe, they go all over the world looking for help.
If they don't have money, they go home and they die.
What we did is a thing called Right to Try.
People sign something and they don't hold the country responsible.
They don't hold the drug company responsible.
It's called Right to Try, and they get the newest, and the best, and the latest medicine where it's looking good, but you're not going to have it for five more years, and you know why they didn't do it?
Because they didn't want to hurt anybody, except the problem is the people were going to die soon.
I said, "They're terminally ill. Let them have it."
We sat down with a great group of leaders, Republican leaders, and honestly, we had some bipartisan support and we got it done.
They've been tried to do it for 45 or so years.
We got it done.
You have to see the results, and I've seen some of the results.
Some of the results are incredible.
We've transformed veteran's health care, including through VA choice, right?
VA choice.
For 48 years they've been trying to get veterans choice.
I thought I had the greatest secret.
You know, I haven't been doing this that long, so four years ago, I'm campaigning for president.
Everyone said, "No, he's only having fun."
Yeah, it's some fun.
This is a lot of fun.
Right?
But for 45 years- But for 45 years they've been trying to get it Veteran's Choice.
So I come back one day, I say to my people, "I have the greatest idea.
I am so smart."
I am like the smart- I have an idea because the veterans are waiting online.
They're waiting online for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ten weeks.
Some are okay and they end up being terminally ill by the time they see the doctors, too long.
And I said, "Folks, I have the greatest idea."
All of my people, I say, "I have the greatest idea.
I'm so smart.
Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to send all those people that can't see a doctor, we just can't get them to see a doctor.
We're going to send them down the road to private doctors and we're going to pay the bill and they're going to get fixed up."
Right?
So smart.
But you see, I said I was smart and they looked back at me and they said, "Sir, we've known about that concept for 45 years.
We just can't get it approved."
But I got it approved.
And I got it approved about 11 months ago.
And the VA is doing fantastically well.
Our veterans are doing great.
That was a big thing.
That was a big thing.
We also got accountability.
Where people could mistreat our veterans, do whatever they want, they could be sadistic.
They could be so many other things.
They could steal, they could rob.
You couldn't do anything, you'd keep them.
You couldn't do a thing.
We got accountability.
Now you look at him, you say, "Get the hell out of here.
You're fired, you're fired.
Now you can fire.
They've let go of more than 8,000 bad people.
We have reduced opioid deaths for the first time, and very substantially, in 30 years.
And we are modernizing critical vaccines.
We're doing a great job with vaccines.
We are creating a pathway to buy drugs from Canada, that are much, much cheaper, in Florida.
Governor Ron DeSantis came to me.
He said, "Sir, this system is so bad."
And you can't fix it unless you have democrat votes, that's why you got to vote the house.
You got to get us back the house.
They say, "Sir, we can buy the drugs in Canada for 50% less."
The same drug made in the same factory, made by the same company.
50% and we can give the benefit for the people that live in Florida, or Colorado, or New Jersey, or wherever you are.
This has been going on for a long time.
No president has wanted to do it.
You know how long it took me to make that decision?
I said, "If you can say 50%, or 25%, or 15% buy it.
Do it.
Go."
And I gave him authorization, "Do it."
We are protecting Medicare for our nation's seniors.
Democrats want, and you know this, Democrats want to raid Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants.
And you know, we all have a heart.
We all have a heart, but when you tell people to come into our country, like this clown governor of California, come into our country.
They're all going to come.
If they think they're going to get free education, free healthcare, they're all going to come.
If you don't say it, they're not going to come.
Because who would even think this?
Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion.
Ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth.
And that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption.
Look at what's happening to their cities.
Los Angeles, it's so sad.
What you see is so sad with the homeless and the way they don't take care of the homeless.
San Francisco, starting in New York.
You could take a look at what's happening to our cities run by Democrats.
It's a disaster.
They don't know what the hell they're doing.
The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and the American dream.
Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed.
We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement.
That's what it is.
It's one of the greatest moments.
It's probably the greatest movement in history.
The 2016 election was probably, I mean you could say, the greatest election in the history of our country.
And now we have to do it again to keep it going.
It's like a giant tree, you plant it, but it takes time to grab on.
We need this next election so badly.
The good news is, it's much easier, because here I've done it all.
I've achieved more than I promised.
I never told you about Space Force.
We got Space Force.
I never told you about all of these things that we got.
We are a big tent party in the true idea.
It's big ideas, and we have a big future together.
This country has tremendous potential, if we don't blow it.
To give former prisoners a second chance at life, we pass bi-partisan, criminal justice reform.
They came to me, they couldn't get it done, including many conservatives.
And these people that I fight every day, they came to me, "Help, help, help.
Criminal justice reform."
I got it done.
As soon as I got it done, they don't even want to mention my name.
I got it done.
I got people to vote for it that they could have never gotten.
President Obama tried, he couldn't get it done.
President Bush couldn't get it.
They couldn't get it done.
That's okay.
They couldn't get it done.
I got it done.
I got it done.
And after I got it done, and I mean solely got it done, and after I got it done they had news conferences.
They're thanking people that I never even heard of.
The only one they didn't think was President Trump.
And I got it done, but that's the way it is.
That's why I always say you have to thank yourself because nobody else is going to do it.
We're fighting to give school choice to every child in America who needs it.
During National School Choice Week, we reaffirmed that no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
School Choice, very important.
Democrats don't want that.
To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 brand new beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written.
And two great Supreme court justices, two great ones.
As we rebuild our military, we have authorized over $160 million to support our warriors at a place called, huh, McGuire Air Force Base and Fort Dix.
Have you ever heard of those places?
Have you ever heard of those places, New Jersey?
$ 160 million, two great places.
I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
Nobody else was going to do it.
They've been trying to do that one for 52 years.
For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America.
Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of New Jersey.
My friends.
At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation.
I really mean that, it's the survival of our nation.
And if you would have had the other party winning this last election, instead of your market being up 72%.
Instead of your 401ks being up numbers that you can't even believe where your wife or your husband says, "Darling, you're the most brilliant person in history.
For years, you've been losing your ass with 401ks.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's a great honor to be in North Carolina.
We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina.
And I'm thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots.
You are great people.
Great people.
I don't know how many people here, but there's a lot.
We said let's keep it down.
They didn't do too good a job, but that's good.
That's good.
Now these crowds, I tell you it's beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot.
This is the most important election we've ever had.
56 days from now, we're going to win North Carolina.
We're going to win four more years in the White House.
This is a choice.
And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades.
I don't think you has a bigger difference and maybe you've never had a bigger difference.
This is the American dream and the other, I don't want to say it because I'll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there.
But the other is a basic disaster for our country.
Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children's future to countries like China.
Remember this, very simple to remember.
If Biden wins, China wins.
It's as simple as that.
So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.
We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we've opened it.
And by the way, your state should be open.
Your state should be open.
Any governor that does that.
And even if you look statistically, it's you it's Michigan, it's a couple of others.
They're closed.
New York.
Look what they're doing in New York, what they're doing to our beautiful New York.
It's so sad.
But you just take a look at what's going on in North Carolina.
They want to open.
They want to open.
They want to open in Michigan so badly.
They want to open.
They want to have football.
They want to have their schools open.
And it's a shame what's going on.
And I'll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open.
They're doing it for political reasons.
They're doing it for political reasons.
They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you're hurting the economy.
Our economy is doing phenomenally well.
And it's not only is it a V, it's a super V. You see what's happened.
We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million.
It's down to 8.4%.
Nobody thought that, 8.4.
So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we're opening it up and your state should go with it.
We're opening it up.
And we will have a great third quarter.
It's going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we're going to have a great third quarter.
We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over.
And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody's taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven't seen.
And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place.
They're Biden people.
They're Biden states and cities.
They're Democrat states.
If they win, the mobs win.
You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal.
Give me that food.
Give me that.
A woman sitting there, she wants to eat.
And they come and they grab her food.
They grab her drink.
Nobody's ever seen stuff like this.
This is all that ideology.
We're not going to let it happen.
We're not going to let it happen.
And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time.
We said, either do it or what going in.
We're going to have to go in, do it.
Let us go in.
We're saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day.
Let us go in.
I said, let us go in.
We'll straighten it out in less than a half an hour.
Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody.
You saw that.
He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently.
He had other charges against him.
And I put out, when is he going to be arrested?
And they went in about 15 minutes later.
And I'll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go.
All they have to do is call us.
It'll all be solved very quickly.
They have to call them.
But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places.
They don't know what the hell they're doing.
If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win.
He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn't mean that's going to stop.
He doesn't, he will never stop.
If they win, it's not going to happen, hopefully.
Because this is not like a second place crowd.
Let's face it.
Are you seeing?
Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out?
That's why he left.
Finally, he left his basement.
He said we got problems.
I don't think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it.
They understand it.
He doesn't.
So I'm running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries.
Because if we win, America wins.
You know that.
You've seen that.
Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you've never seen.
They weren't even broken.
They were bad.
They were bad from day one.
Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%.
In fact, I got it down to 98%.
Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98.
And they all said, no, no, it's got to be a 100.
I said, somebody else could finish.
We want to get home.
They said, no, you've got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we're bringing them home.
We're bringing them home.
These great, great warriors.
People don't like it when I say that.
Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world.
And now we are very simply, we're doing it again and we're on track to have, as I said, the best year we've ever had next year.
You just had the best year.
You just had the best year of the history of your state last year.
We've created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months.
But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse.
He won't even know the difference.
How's the economy?
Not good, sir.
We're in a depression.
We are?
What's that?
Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that.
And I've spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country.
We've never had so many jobs.
We're up to 160 million jobs.
We were never anywhere close.
We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that.
Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway.
On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they're doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country.
You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order.
You want to knock them down?
That's fine.
But you go to jail for 10 years.
It was amazing.
It was amazing how that stopped.
And then they said, well, we'll do it easily.
We'll do it through the process because they don't want to spend 10 years.
You know, they'd look at it.
They'd say not worth it.
10 years is too much.
But the DC committee, did you see about that?
They want to change the name of the Washington Monument.
They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument.
Now, we're talking the big stuff.
They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there.
But I said that was going to happen.
Don't worry about it.
You don't have a thing to worry about.
If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala.
Remember Kamala?
She started at 15.
She was supposed to win.
Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four.
It's like a free fall.
You know what, people don't like her.
Nobody likes her.
She could never be the first woman president.
She could never be.
That would be an insult to our country.
Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America's borders, confiscate your guns.
He wants to get rid of your second amendment.
We're going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs.
You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated.
They want to build low income projects in the suburbs.
They've been doing it.
They've been destroying suburbs.
We're not doing it anymore.
Somebody said suburban women, how's Trump doing?
But do you remember last time too?
They said women don't like Trump.
I said, I think they do.
I think they do.
They said women don't, and then we did great with women.
And remember that great.
Was that one of the greatest evenings ever?
Four years ago.
That was one of the greatest.
But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better.
Now we're doing really well.
African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better.
He did better with African Americans than we thought.
He did better with Hispanic than we thought.
He did better with Asians than we thought.
He did really well with women.
What's this all about?
Ladies and gentlemen.
And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016.
You remember that evening?
Was that the craziest?
That was the craziest thing.
And they thought, I think they didn't think it, but I'll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now.
They don't understand.
They do understand it.
They do.
Right?
They understand it.
Look at that beautiful dress.
And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much.
Beautiful.
Like it.
But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again.
Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me.
We're not shutting it down again.
We don't have to.
We learned about the disease.
We did the right thing.
We saved millions of lives.
People don't realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China.
We put a ban on China, heavily infected.
And Biden was against it.
Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit.
It's clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win.
They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we've never seen before.
That's what's happening.
That's what's happening.
And never forget, they're coming after me because I'm fighting for you.
There's a lot of truth in that one.
And they do come after me.
They do come after me.
They have more things to say about me.
Every day, it's something.
They said, you see the plane where it is?
Sir, would you like to take the car?
I say, why?
I'm saying what?
Well, I heard you had a limp.
I do?
I don't know about a limp.
I don't have a limp.
Hey, someday, I'm going to have a limp.
I'll let you know when.
You'll see it.
No, they make this stuff up.
They make it up.
They make stuff.
It's called disinformation.
They give a phony deal out.
They did it two days ago with the military.
There's nobody that loves the military more than me.
I was very lucky though.
I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that.
They were there.
They were there.
But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many.
Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier.
It was all made up.
And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you'd have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they'd be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it's treason or whatever else you want to call it.
And it's a disgrace that it's taken this long.
It's a disgrace that it's taken this long.
And let me just tell you a little secret.
Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden.
Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don't you use the Logan Act on General Flynn?
Look at General Flynn, what he's going through for years.
If that were ever reversed, I'm telling you, you'd have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago.
It's a disgrace, but let's see what happens.
Biden's a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities.
And you know, he talks about like, well, he's going to do this.
He's going to … He doesn't have any idea.
He has no clue.
He's going to do this.
He's been there for 47 years.
And he just really left.
He left three and a half, four years ago.
So he just left, but he's been there for 47 years.
I'm going to do this.
After 47 years, he's had a change of heart.
This is the craziest election.
This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what's the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe?
So the difference is the following.
She's meaner, probably not as nice.
I don't know.
You can't get any worse than her, when you think.
But the big difference is she's smarter than he is.
Okay.
He's a nicer person, but he's not smart.
He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now.
The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party's nomination.
Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone.
And by the way, you know who's further left than crazy Bernie?
Kamala, Kamala, Kamala.
You remember she left the race.
Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California.
I don't know.
Maybe we'll make a play for that one too.
But they picked somebody from California.
I don't quite get it, but you always pick somebody that's hot.
That's going up in the polls, going up.
Frankly, I'm not sure.
I don't think I've ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate.
Right?
Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot.
He gave her a hell of a fight.
A lot of people think he won and it got taken away.
One thing about Bernie, he's the greatest loser I've ever seen because look, any children here?
No not too many, but they've heard it before.
He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again.
Biden got the nomination.
He got the nomination.
But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas?
She finally faded.
She faded badly.
But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee.
And I don't know who I'd rather run against.
One is super left.
The other one's had to become super left.
One is competent.
The other one is only half competent now and heading south.
He's half competent and heading south rapidly.
But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they're united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense.
That's why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over.
If you look at that, it's over the law abiding areas that we have.
Republican cities and towns are doing great.
We're doing great.
And we don't have crime and we don't have this violence.
Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot.
They're actually shot and killed.
New York, the same thing.
New York's gone through the roof.
They were up 300% in certain categories.
And you say, what's happening?
And we want to send them in so badly.
Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters.
And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why?
Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you're campaigning, you can't have more than five people.
They- That if you're campaigning you can't have more than five people.
They did that for me.
If you are going to church you can't go to church anymore.
You can't go to church.
You can't go to church, you can't do anything.
You have to stay in your house but if you're willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you're willing to riot and stand on top of each other's face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you're allowed to do that because you're considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don't listen to too much, maybe I should.
"Sir, please don't say law and order.
That's too tough."
Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy.
They say, "Say law and order but with safety."
I said, "Look, people get it.
It's just law and order, is that okay?"
We want law and order.
They say, "Law and order and safety, sir.
Could you add the word safety?
Because it's …" I said, "I don't want to add."
It's sort of obvious, right?
We want law, we want order.
Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist.
By the way I've gotten the support of almost every police group in the country.
Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina.
All over the country, but did you notice he's starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that?
He sees what's going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what's going on.
Now he's starting to say, "No, we need law and order."
No he didn't say that, did he?
He'll never get to say that, can't say that because then it'd lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party.
You take a look at … You don't want to be dealing with the left.
These people are stone cold crazy, you don't want to be dealing.
Meanwhile Biden, he doesn't say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities.
They're murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it.
My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down.
Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this.
These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you're sitting there.
You'll be taking your monuments down.
You'll be taking your statues down.
I'm not kidding, you'll be taking them down.
You have to look at the D.C. report, I'm just telling you, go get it, you wouldn't even believe it.
It's too crazy to even talk about, but we're never going to give them a chance to do it.
We're never giving them a chance.
We're going to win, we're going to win big.
This is a very important state, and by the way … By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, "Well I wanted to go and vote, darling.
I wanted to go and vote.
Why are they sending me those ballots?"
There's something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we're doing great there.
Now the governor decides we're doing so well that they're going to send out unsolicited.
You have solicited and unsolicited.
They're going to send out millions of ballots to you.
People that never really thought in terms of it.
Now sometimes you'll ask for a ballot.
That's a solicited ballot.
It's okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it.
Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots.
Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts.
Make sure it counts.
Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things.
That's the only way as far as the eye can see, but they'll correct it.
They'll say, "He's wrong, it was 14,500, he's misrepresenting.
He's misrepresenting."
Now I was told we have 15,000 and we're in the middle of an airport someplace.
It's a wonderful thing.
I actually think … I don't know if you agree.
So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren't working out too well, right?
You can't really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we're rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds.
I think we have bigger crowds potentially.
We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport.
We're doing all mostly hangar things because we're outside.
Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right?
But they say it's very much different.
So we're doing these and we're doing the outdoors, we're doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago.
It's pretty amazing.
It's pretty amazing.
We started off in New Hampshire, we said, "Look, let's have 1,000 people," and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more.
We're trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it's really amazing what's going on.
All over the country, it's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's a great thing.
More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, "I don't know.
That's a lot of …" You know what?
I've actually done more than I promised.
Build a wall, build a wall, true.
I've done more.
For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force.
We built, think of it.
A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force.
I never talked about that.
That's something we never talked about.
I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing.
I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy.
That was not easy, it was very hard.
But what we've done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles.
It's exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted.
I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it.
"Sir, we have to be able to see through."
I said, "All right, let's go.
Much more expensive."
I said, "Let's go."
So we're over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we've ever had by far and it's a good time to have it too.
That's right.
Mexico is going to pay for it.
What happens if they fight us?
Remember that answer?
It's going to get 10 feet higher.
Remember that.
What happens if they fight us on the wall?
The wall's going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great.
In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country.
Can you imagine that?
27,000, and I did that so that we don't put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple.
I said you got to do it and the president's been great, he's a friend of mine, he's doing a very good job.
Not easy, Mexico's not easy, but he's doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it's a tremendous wall.
It's everything that the Border Patrol wanted.
I gave them everything.
I said, "What else do you want?"
It's wired for every single thing you could have.
Remember the Democrats, "We don't want a wall, we want drones flying."
Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right?
Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail.
Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge.
Now last night though, they arrested more than they've ever done because we said you have to.
We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we'll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they're finally, after 107 days, like they're finally doing what they're supposed to be doing but we'll let you know very soon.
Otherwise we're going in.
The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide.
Now you got to understand, Bernie's a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters.
I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade.
They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they're ripping us off on trade.
I agree with him on that.
The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don't.
They don't have a clue.
They just know they're being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that.
That's a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing.
We appreciate it, we hope we don't lose it.
Because we've really implemented things.
We've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China's never given us $0.10.
It's a one-way street with China.
They haven't given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn't dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently.
It's a great deal.
They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they're smart, very smart.
Instead of saying he's not talking very nicely about us and we're not going to order any more, we're not going to do business, no.
Instead they do the opposite.
They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy.
Our farmers are very happy.
Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that's what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody's ever done this before.
Nobody's ever done this before.
With Biden it's the reverse.
His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with.
Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he'll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all.
Never happened before.
Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists.
My plan is to arrest them.
So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice.
Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else.
Wait till you see the numbers.
Wait till you see the numbers.
You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying.
I said, "That's a big number, right?"
I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they're only lying if it's us because they don't want to be bothered.
In other words they're not lying about Sleepy Joe, they're lying about us, and I don't know if I'm supposed to love that or hate it, I don't know if it's an insult or not but I will take it.
We don't give a damn.
If that's the case, we have a virtual landslide going.
We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it it would have been terrible, but you know what?
Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word.
We had the call perfectly and if I didn't have it, somehow with these people I guess I'd still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy's done a fantastic job.
He really has.
With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him.
He's not too popular, I want to tell you, he's not a very popular guy in Utah.
He's not too popular.
So it was 52.5 to a half.
He's a beauty, I'll tell you that guy.
He couldn't get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now.
Remember Utah, they said it's too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah.
Do you remember that like immediately?
I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin.
McMuffin, he was supposed to be second.
Even Hillary beat him.
What a group.
Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan?
Get out and vote for him.
Get out and vote for him, okay?
I'll tell you he'll be a great governor.
He loves your state, he'll be a great governor.
Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you're going to do well, Dan.
I know you're really getting up there, it's getting very close.
I'll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him.
You know we had to take our convention away, he said you're allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you're not supposed to have political rallies.
I said, "You know the money that your state is going to be losing?"
But if this guy doesn't open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn't open up your state, you have no choice, you're going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you'll be so good.
Dan Forest, go and vote.
The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O'Neill.
Jim?
Where is Jim?
Thank you Jim, thank you very much.
Good luck.
Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots.
I don't like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff.
I don't like it.
I look at these crowds and if they're going to cheat crowds are meaningless.
Really, if they're going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless.
Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there.
Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do.
Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win.
We're going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we're going to win Florida.
North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great.
Thank you Michael.
Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney.
Where's Mick?
Oh, I didn't know Mick was here.
Look at him.
What a good guy.
Thank you Mick.
We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff?
We love Mark.
Doing a great job.
He's doing a great job, Robert O'Brien.
Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert?
50, 50 and 0.
We're 50 and 0 on hostages.
We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you'd never even heard of and it's been pretty amazing.
Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here.
Mick it's good to see you.
Oh wait a minute, wait.
It's a very, very outstanding senator.
Oh I'm lucky I got to see that.
We love South Carolina, right?
Come here.
Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham.
Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones.
Two great ones.
They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey.
That's good and Tim is another one.
So we have just incredible people in the party.
We've achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that's driving them crazy.
We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses.
Remember, that was a terrible thing.
People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost – 53].
No, but it was a terrible thing.
You'd pass away and your kids would get the farm, they'd go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive.
They'd put big mortgages on the farm, they'd lose the farm, they'd lose the business.
You don't have that anymore.
I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster.
For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back.
Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens.
Think of it.
But the big deal is, he's changed.
He's changed.
"After 47 years I've changed.
I swear to you I've changed."
Did you see him in the debates?
He was not too good, but that's okay.
He was better against Bernie.
Something's going on there, I don't know.
You know what I'm talking about.
But he was better against Bernie.
But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want.
Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything.
Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers.
If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice.
You believe it lawyers?
This is what we need, is more lawyers.
This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
That's courtesy of Biden and his friends.
Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it's been incredible.
Everyone said, "Impossible."
They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done.
And it's a great deal.
And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It's such a disincentive to do that.
Now that was the thing that was most important to me.
I used to hate when I'd see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they'd make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing.
It doesn't work that way anymore.
I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs.
Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA.
In the face of China's economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers.
I will always stand with American agriculture.
These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we're not going to let others take advantage of them.
For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it's just been this way for 20 years.
Now, it's going back up.
I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right?
If I didn't do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy.
If I didn't do that, I think you wouldn't have any farmers right now.
Really.
It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers.
28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion.
I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy.
I said, "Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?"
He said, "Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16."
So I said, "28, okay, that's fine."
I said, "We will give them 28 billion.
They were unfairly targeted."
And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly.
Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly?
Iran would like them very badly.
Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash.
And you know what's going to happen?
They're just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes.
Their GDP went down 24%.
Nobody ever heard of that before.
Their country is in trouble.
I don't want them to be in trouble, but they're going to wait till after the election.
When I win the election, they're going to come to us and make a deal so fast.
Watch how fast it'll be.
They're dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait.
"Let's wait two months, maybe we'll get lucky.
Maybe we're going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we're going to make a great deal."
No, there'll be in immediately after the election and they'll make a deal, we'll make a fair deal with them.
But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal.
I ended last administration's war on American energy.
Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters.
We don't want to buy energy.
We've done that for a long time, for decades and decades.
We don't want to do that anymore.
I like being energy independent, don't you?
And I'm sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it's below $2.
You said, "How the hell did this ever happen?
Thank you President Trump."
Right?
Thank you President Trump And look at your electric bills, everything else.
These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times.
The Green New Deal, it's called the green new nightmare.
While I'm president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent.
It should be for many, many years to come.
Because the fact is, we don't have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel.
We've been very good to Israel.
But other than that, we don't have to be in the Middle East.
We don't need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don't need that anymore.
We have more than they do, isn't that nice?
After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country.
America first.
It's America first.
To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones.
I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy.
He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn't do.
And Biden.
I call it Obiden.
O Biden.
It's too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden.
And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded.
And we're heading back to that level rapidly.
Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters.
He betrayed them.
Look at 1994, take a look at that.
He betrayed them, what he did to them.
He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing.
They were all sent to Beijing.
So many people went there.
They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing.
He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai.
Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first.
And actually, if we weren't interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere.
And nobody has been through what I've been through as president of the United States, nobody.
They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press.
I said, "There's no way he got worse than me."
But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news.
Maybe in his case, it was real.
I can tell you, in my case, it's fake.
It's totally fake.
But nobody's been and should never be allowed to happen again.
Let's see what happens.
We caught them cold.
Let's see what happens.
But if we didn't have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things.
31].
She could have said, "Okay."
She could have said, "You got me."
But she said, "I got set up by the beauty parlor owner," who happens to be a Trump person by the way.
I like the beauty parlor owner.
She said, "I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor.
She set me up."
I said, "How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?"
No, it's terrible, she's always preaching about the mask.
"You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor.
When you go to bed at night, put the mask on."
I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I'm reelected the best is yet to come.
I'll tell you that.
Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration.
Under my administration, we've achieved the most secure border in American history.
Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot.
Remember they said, "Walls are old fashioned.
They don't work."
Really?
I always say, and I've said it four or five times.
I'll say it again if you'd like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years.
If you're lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn't it?
But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop.
Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right?
Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right?
The wheel and the wall.
Maybe I'm wrong, who knows?
But I would say walls and wheels have a great future.
We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13.
We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we've ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades.
We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history.
I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem.
And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades.
Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement.
Do you believe that?
I said, "Let me see that one."
Now we did something that nobody thought was possible.
Man, it's Israel, as you see, and as you've read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East.
They all want to come in.
It's going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture.
We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him.
Why didn't Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him.
The world's number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too.
Soleimani.
Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades.
We kept America out of new wars and we're bringing our troops back home.
We're bringing them back home from all these far away places.
We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it?
Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn't find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS.
Couldn't find him, they looked, they couldn't find him.
I found him and we hit him good.
We hit him good.
And you saw the Mueller family on television.
You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that.
You should see it, it was incredible.
Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world.
How are we doing with China?
We just have the plague, we've had other plagues sent by them.
I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think?
I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election.
This was going to be so easy.
I probably would have not been here tonight.
I would have said, "No, we don't have to bother.
This is going to be…" And now we have to work against a guy that doesn't know where he is, I can't believe it.
When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic.
Do you remember that?
I banned it.
Everybody told me, "No, no, no, you don't have to do that."
But I said, "We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they're coming here," so I banned it.
Later on it was said to be a great move.
If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.
If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won't take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn't even have a job.
Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong.
When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II.
We're delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers.
The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world.
People don't know that because the fake news doesn't want to write about it.
Under Operation Warp Speed, we're producing a vaccine in record time.
This is a vaccine that we're going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps.
And this is something that's incredible.
This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations.
We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric.
That's what they're talking about.
So now they know we have it.
It's only a question of weeks or a small amount of time.
So instead of saying, "That's a great thing.
We're going to save lives," they're trying to disparage it, they're trying to make it politics.
They're trying to do so.
And now what's going to happen is we'll have it, and people won't want to take it.
That's really bad.
Okay?
That's really bad.
But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we're close to putting it out, getting it out, and we're going to get it out fast.
The vaccine will be safe.
These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it'll be effective and it'll be delivered before the end of the year.
And maybe as I said, much sooner than that.
Joe Biden's plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more.
And that's what you're in right now.
You're in a shutdown.
It's crazy.
I've been to many states, they're not in shutdowns and they're doing better.
They're doing better.
Somebody's got to speak to this man, Dan.
Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan.
Go in a little early and say, "You don't know what the hell you're doing?
You don't know what you're doing.
They're hurting our people."
North Carolina has to open up.
By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school.
You ever see the statistics on young people?
I don't know.
They have a great immune system.
Let's get some of that immune system, but they're amazing.
I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they're not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%.
It's an incredible thing.
Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible.
But young people are very strong against this horrible disease.
Through our historic China virus relief programs, we've saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers.
That worked out great.
We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save- … And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state's tobacco growers.
We saved your tobacco growers.
We have them very much in our sites.
We want to help them.
The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger.
Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations.
We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%.
You couldn't build a road.
We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we'll have it down to one.
You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you're going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months.
You're not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand.
I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down.
He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records.
You wouldn't believe.
I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is.
He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country.
Oh, thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
And considering that we caught President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, spying on our campaign, treason, will probably be entitled to another four more years after that.
I wanted to thank you, and Art and Brandon, you're incredible.
I've known you now a long time.
Right from the beginning, we had the chemistry, we had that good chemistry… Oh, sit down.
It's 122 degrees in this place.
And we have our great Governor.
Governor, can we make it a little bit, just a little.
This is like a test.
You think Joe Biden could do this?
I don't think so.
So I'm thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona To proudly accept the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council, that's a big deal.
And they are great friends of mine.
And we're building the wall.
Next week, we'll be up to 300 miles of incredible wall.
And our numbers are the best.
We are very tough at the border.
When people want to come in, for our farmers, et cetera, et cetera, we're not going to hurt our farmers, but we've never had better numbers than we have right now.
And that's been helped because we're at a little bit over 280 miles right now, we have never been helped like this.
Wall, there are two things, in a thousand years you can come back, two things will never, with technology it's obsolete before you even put it in the box, but two things never get old wheels and walls.
Wheels and wall.
If you come back in a thousand years, you'll say, "Well, we still have wheels in walls."
And that's the only thing you'll recognize.
The National Border Patrol Council is the official union representing the incredible heroes of the United States Border Patrol.
They've been my friends from the beginning.
To every border agent, and I just met some unbelievable people backstage, these are great people, and every family member here today, you have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation.
And I want to thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
As you know, better than anyone, the survival of our nation is at stake in this election.
And I will tell you, I never thought I'd say it because we had a great election.
We had a great election a little while ago.
Four years ago, I never thought I'd say anything could compete with 2016.
This election that we're going into is the most important election in the history of our country, because we had crooked Hillary, but this is something, these people are sick.
And we have to make sure that this radical left socialist and beyond, because this is beyond socialism, that it doesn't happen, or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids.
So we can't do it.
Most important election, November 3rd, get out and vote.
Joe Biden is the puppet of the radical left wing movement that seeks the complete elimination of America's borders and boundaries.
They want to take the wall down, they don't want to have borders, they want to have sanctuary cities, lots of bad things they want.
Following orders from his boss.
I guess his new boss is Bernie Sanders.
Can you believe that?
Crazy Bernie.
Joe Biden has pledged to abolish immigration enforcement, suspend all removals, provide free government healthcare, and they want to give it to illegal aliens.
You don't get it.
Restore, catching and release.
Shield violent criminal aliens.
This is what they want to do.
And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country.
We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before.
You get free education, you get free healthcare, why wouldn't they come?
Let's go to America.
The Biden plan would unleash a flood of illegal immigration like the world has never seen.
It's crazy.
Biden's plan is the most radical, extreme, reckless, dangerous, and deadly immigration plan ever put forward by a major party candidate.
It must be defeated, and it will be defeated on November 3rd.
It will be defeated.
At last night's Democrat convention, which by the way, got very bad ratings, I have to tell you.
Unity.
They talk about unity.
They want to bring unity.
And then you listen to Michelle Obama's speech, which was obsolete by the time it got there.
She taped it.
No, she taped the speech.
It was obsolete.
She must have taped it about three weeks before.
I'm speaking next Thursday, maybe I'll tape it.
But I don't think that goes.
That's so much nicer, to tape it, you do it, nice air conditioned room.
And she not only taped it, but tell me when you hear a divisive speech… They talk about me as being a divider.
I'm not a divider.
I bring people together.
We were bringing people together.
We were bringing people together, like never before.
Success was bringing everyone together, and then we got hit with the China virus, but we were bringing people together.
But one of the opening speakers last night said that America will go to hell if we don't have open borders.
Think of that.
Go to hell.
When a country doesn't have borders, you don't have a country.
Today, a Democrat speaker at the convention said, "We're talking about abolishing the police, we're talking about abolishing ICE, we're talking about abolishing prisons."
Biden's campaign has turned into a cult for open border and others Zealots.
By the way, they want to double and triple your taxes, they want to increase regulations, they want to spend very little money on our vets, after we took care of our vets better than anyone's.
91% approval rate.
And they want to spend much less on our military, we've totally rebuilt.
Two and a half trillion dollars, we've totally rebuilt our military.
Bernie Sanders declared, in his speech, many of the ideas that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream.
That's Bernie Sanders.
Because Joe, he doesn't know where he is.
But if he did, he's been brought so far left that our country will not be the country that we know.
It will have problems, it will go down.
Your stocks will be gone, your 401ks will disappear.
And right now, who has the 401k?
And then the rest of you, many of you have stocks, and you do it a different way.
That will go down 50, 60, 70%, 80%.
And if you held on, like I said to do, we went down a little while we got hit with a virus.
Now, NASDAQ just broke an all time record.
SNP, just broke an all time record.
Socialism is the mainstream of the Biden campaign and it's not the mainstream of America.
Remember I said, we will never have a socialist country.
On November 3rd.
The people of Arizona, our great state, we love Arizona.
I won it last time, by a lot.
And I hear we're going to win it by even more this time.
Don't forget, last time I talked, I said we're going to give you a tax cuts, I gave you.
I said, we're going to give you a massive regulation cuts.
Give you your tax cuts, I gave them to you.
I said we're going to give you massive regulation cuts, we're going to give you great everything.
We even did Right to Try medicine.
You know all about that.
We did things that I didn't even talk about it, we did.
We did a thing called the Space Force.
You never heard me talking about.
I'm the only candidate that gave you more than I promised in the campaign.
It's true.
I'm the only one ever, maybe ever.
Or we'll head to the polls and together we'll stop the left and win four more years in the White House.
We're joined today by some incredible people, friends of mine, great, great people.
And I want to congratulate your governor because we had a spike and he knocked that spike out so fast.
I don't know.
Are you sure you even had a spike?
Doug Ducey, a great governor, great man, and a somebody that won by about 16 or 17 points.
That's not so bad.
And I think you're more popular today.
What a job you've done.
Thank you very much, Doug.
A friend of mine and somebody who's a great fighter pilot, and I had a lot of people tell me she could really wheel the Warthog, right?
The Warthog.
She said, "I love that plane," but she was a great, great fighter pilot, one of the best they were telling me.
This was a group and they knew a very well.
A lot of friends you have.
And specifically she said, "Could you extend that plane?
That's the best plane.
It never breaks down.
It just is a winner."
But Martha McSally is an extraordinary person, and she's fighting for us, and she's helping us, and we have to bring her into the center.
Thank you, Martha.
And she's running against a gentlemen who is, when you read what he's done, when you read what he said about the second amendment and about all other things, you're not going to want to vote for.
You're not going to want to have them play with your second amendment.
I'll tell you what.
If I weren't President, I don't believe, Doug, you'd have a second amendment right now.
I don't think you'd have.
The pressure that was put on to get rid of it, or to basically obliterate it, make it so it's meaningless.
You will always have the right to bear arms.
You will always have that.
A few friends of mine who are warriors.
Paul Gosar.
Paul.
Where's Paul?
Paul, stand up.
Will you?
Paul Gosar.
Thank you, Paul.
Appreciate.
Great job you're doing.
These are warriors.
They really are.
When they went and they tried to make a play at your President, they had to get through the House.
What were we?
197 and nothing.
That's never happened before.
Everybody came together.
The Republicans came.
Other than Mitt Romney, one half a vote.
One half a brain.
Another friend of mine and incredible fighter, and somebody that loves his state, and I'll tell you, the Freedom Caucus, right?
And we have a man named Andy Biggs here.
He's a fighter.
He's a fighter.
And he loves our vets, and he loves our military, and you love our second amendment, right?
And we're not going to do anything with it.
They will destroy that second amendment.
Just remember I said it, but you're not going to have to worry about it because it's not going to happen.
A woman who really distinguished herself, she became a star.
She became a star overnight.
There was nobody tougher.
There was nobody smarter.
There was nobody better than Debbie Lesko.
Great job, Debbie.
Thank you.
We want her on our side.
Right fellas?
We got to have her on our side.
Also, thanks to Arizona Republican party chairman, I knew this was going to happen.
I knew that she was going.
She never stops.
She never gives up.
Kelly Ward.
Kelly, thank you.
Thank you, Kelly.
Great job you're doing.
Are we winning?
Okay, good.
I think we are.
That's what they say.
We better win.
If we don't win, this country is in big trouble.
Big trouble.
Also a great friend of all of ours, former State Treasurer of Arizona, Jeff DeWitt.
Thank you Jeff.
And a man who didn't choke under pressure.
I don't even know if he's here.
I think he might be here.
He never choked.
He kicked for 11 years.
You know what that is?
You ever see a golfer.
They miss a three footer.
They miss a three footer.
They can't take it back.
They choke, choke, choke.
Well, kickers are the same.
Right?
NFL kickers.
This guy lasted 11 years.
He's one of the best kickers ever.
NFL kicker, Jay Feely.
Where's Jay?
Where is Jay?
He's here someplace.
Where is he?
Jay?
What happened?
You couldn't get a good seat, Jay.
I remember the 61 yarder.
That was a heartbreaker.
Right?
But the only thing is, I'll bet you this man would stand, only stand, for our National Anthem.
That's one thing.
That's one thing I can tell you.
And if they don't stand for our flag, if they don't stand for our National Anthem, I turn off the game.
Other than that, I'd like to watch, but I turn off the game.
And by the way, I thought they learned that lesson a little while ago.
I thought they learned that lesson two years ago, but maybe not, but they will.
They'll learn it again.
This time it'll go even faster.
For decades, Washington politicians like Biden allowed an endless supply of illegal foreign labor to decimate American jobs and wages.
Also, the crime was incredible what happened.
They allowed criminal gangs to menace, maim and terrorize innocent citizens.
They came in.
They would maim and terrorize, and we have done something with our border patrol.
And by the way, ICE, ICE is great.
ICE has taken out thousands and thousands of MS-13, and you don't want the job.
There's some tough people here.
None of you want the job.
It's a tough job, but they like it, and they're great Patriots, and they've done a fantastic job.
They ceded control of the border to the most dangerous and ruthless cartels on earth.
This is what would happen.
They have ceded.
And what we've done, did you ever notice the caravans?
What happened?
Debbie, there are no more caravans.
What happened?
What happened to the caravans?
They don't come up anymore.
The caravans don't come up.
You know, we were paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, hundreds of millions.
And I said, "Well, why are we doing that?"
And they wouldn't take.
When we caught a murderer and we wanted to bring it back to one of those countries, they wouldn't take him.
And they wouldn't take him under the Obama administration.
So we got stuck with them because they'd fly in.
They'd say, "Don't land your plane."
And I said something very simple.
I said, "That's okay.
We don't have to do that.
We're not going to pay you anymore.
We stopped payment."
We stopped payment.
It's amazing how that works, Doug.
Right?
We stopped payment and they called.
They said, "We'd love to take them.
We'd be honored to take them."
So we take them back by the thousands, by the thousands.
They let lethal poisonous drugs pour freely into our schools and our communities, but no more.
It's not happening anymore.
The cruel and heartless portrayal of the American people ended the day I took the oath of office, and now that we have more than half of the wall built, and do you notice they don't talk about the wall anymore.
They don't talk.
Why don't you talk?
I went, "Look at all those people back there."
That's called fake news, fake news.
Look at them.
It's the fake news.
They don't talk about the wall anymore.
See, we won.
We got the wall.
It's going to be up to 300 next week and it's going to be finished very soon.
And as soon as we want, all of a sudden, they never talk about it.
But you know where I talk about it?
Numbers.
The numbers are so good.
The numbers are so low.
We've never had numbers like this because that big portion of wall already built, you don't get through it.
You can't get through it.
You can climb Mount Everest, and you're going to have an awful hard time getting over that sucker.
I stood up to the lobbyists.
Everybody fought us, the Democrats, everyone.
I fought the special interests.
I kept every single promise that I made, and now I'm doing it with the drug companies.
I just created Favorite Nation.
So if a nation buys it for less and they buy it for a fraction of what we pay, the drug companies have to sell it to us for the same price.
And they're spending so much.
They're spending millions of dollars on advertising.
Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they're rich, the farmer, it's called Big Farmer, the number one lobbyist.
They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online.
Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Farmer against me, you know your drug prices are coming down.
That's what it is.
They're not happy.
And we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate.
It's going to the people now.
We're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people.
They are not happy.
I have a lot of people in that industry do not like me too much.
But you are going to get 50.
You are going to get, and the Democrats would never do it, Biden would never do it because he doesn't understand it, but they would never do it.
They would in a million years, they wouldn't do it.
It took a lot of guts to do it.
I had a lot of people, a lot of good politicians go, "Sir, I don't think you should do it."
I wonder why you're saying that, but we did it.
We're going to have drug prices reduced over a very short period of time, by not 2%, and last year they went down a little bit, first time in 51 years that drug prices went down but a little bit, we're going to have prices dropping 50, 60, and even 70%.
Drugs.
About time.
And I'm proud to say that they've achieved the most secure border, our border patrol, in the history of the United States of America.
We now have the most secure border we've ever had and it's only going to get better.
And we want people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right?
And we want people- … people to come in, but we want them to come in through merit, right?
And we want people that are going to come in and are going to love for our country, not hate our country.
Here in Yuma, Arizona, we've invested over $1.7 billion and poured 180,000 cubic yards, that's a lot of concrete, to build 108 miles of powerful border wall.
I know who's going to vote for me.
I don't know though, I think I'm going to win Yuma.
What do you think, Doug?
I think, when I hear those numbers, when we hear those numbers, we're winning.
We're going to win Yuma big.
Now you see it and you see what's going up and it's an incredible structure, all capable, all wired up for cameras, for everything you can have.
Technology is incredible.
In total, I've already completely planned for the final execution, we're going to have, by the end of the year, everything that we said is going to be built.
We may actually build some more in some soft areas that we've noticed over the last two years.
So we actually may put up some additional, but we will have it completed, everything we said, by the end of the year and nobody thought that was possible.
And we've reduced illegal border crossings by 60% since this time last year.
And if we keep going at the rate, it'll be about 85% in about two months.
So it's a great honor.
And you know what?
Your community is much safer, you see the difference, it's a much safer place to be.
But more important than these numbers is the fact that we've ended catch and release.
You know what catch and release is?
These great men and women catch somebody, maybe a murderer, maybe a rapist, maybe a trafficker, they catch somebody, take his name, take his number and they release them into our country.
And they say, "Come back in four years, you have a trial."
No more.
We take them out.
We bring them out.
And nobody said that was possible because I couldn't have gotten it through the Democrats because they don't like that.
So we have people coming in to this country, some great people, some really bad people too.
And I mean murders and I mean rapist, I mean really bad people and they don't get in and they don't get back.
When we bring them back to their country, could be Mexico also, they don't come back.
Under the Obama Biden, I call it OBiden, Under the OBiden administration, our agents were ordered to ignore the law and release illegal aliens by the hundreds of thousands.
And by the way, Mark Morgan, where's the great Mark Morgan?
He's around here someplace.
Mark Morgan has been so incredible, one of our executives, he said, "We never built the cages.
Those cages were built in 2014 by Obama."
We never the cages, they were built by Obama and the fake news is constantly saying that I built cages for children.
I didn't build them.
They were built in 2014.
There was a headline in Time magazine about the cage and somebody called in that built it.
They said, "He didn't build it, we built that for the Obama administration."
But they don't stop, they keep calling it, they say I built the cages.
You'll hear it in one of the debates.
They'll say, "You built cages president."
I said, "No, I didn't build cages.
That was built by Obama."
Under the Trump administration, if you cross our border illegally, you are quickly apprehended and swiftly returned back home.
We are proudly defending the job safety and security of the American people, which is what I promised to do.
Nobody told me it was going to be this hard.
Nobody told me I was going to have the Democrats go totally crazy.
This was like a life and death war.
You know why they don't talk about it anymore?
Because they know it's bad politics, because they know having a wall, they can't win that one.
So they just say, "Let's forget it ever happened.'
Because we won and they say, "Let's forget."
They don't want to talk about it.
That includes the millions of incredible Hispanic Americans who follow our laws, uplift our community and protect our nation, in uniform.
Half of all border patrol agents are Hispanic Americans, I was just with them.
And today I salute each and every one of those true American heroes and that's what they are.
And nobody understands the border better than Hispanics.
They know what's good, what's bad.
They don't want bad people coming into our country, taking their jobs, taking their homes, causing crime.
Hispanic Americans are the people that are most in favor of what we're doing on the border because they understand it.
They understand it better than anybody.
With the help of these patriots, we've stopped the rampant asylum fraud, shut down the human smugglers and we're finding the drug dealers, traffickers, predators, and we're throwing them to hell in jail or sending them back home.
MS-13, for the first time that you've ever seen this, MS-13 is totally on the run.
Many of its leaders are right now behind bars and we're deporting its members in record numbers we've never reported.
I can't believe how many there are.
But if Biden wins, it will be a giant jail break for MS-13 and vicious criminal gangs.
China wants him to win so badly.
Iran wants him to win so badly.
When we win, I'll have a deal with the red within a month, watch, because they're dying to make a deal.
But that last hope that Biden will win, they will own our country, China, they will own our country.
We made such a great deal.
Last week they had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, the largest single order.
Then they did it again.
You know why they're doing that?
Because they know I'm angry, because they know I don't care so much anymore.
We made a great trade deal, but I don't care.
But it shows you how smart they are, Doug.
Another with normal brain power, they'd say, "Well, I'm not going to buy any more corn."
That's good.
And we'll just decouple, thank you very much.
But they go the opposite.
They buy so much, good record numbers, soybeans record numbers.
Last week, biggest ever, 42% of our farmers crop is now China, over the last little while.
You know why?
Because they don't want bad things to happen, that's why.
So they're very smart.
When I have every farmer in the country calling and saying, "Please don't do anything."
They're very, very smart, but we can never forget what China did to this country and did to the world.
The historic achievements that I've discussed today are only a slim fraction of the extraordinary accomplishment that we've all done together in the last four years.
Here's just a short list of our landmarks.
Really they are landmarks, true landmarks.
We instituted a national security travel ban on the world's most dangerous regions, including jihadist regions, keeping terrorists and extremists out of our country.
Everyone said, "Oh, that's so bad."
Remember when they said, "Oh, that's so bad."
I don't think it's so bad at all.
We won the travel ban.
The fake news said we didn't because we lost in the lower court, we lost in the second court and we won in the Supreme court.
So they said we lost.
Can you believe it?
They said we lost Debbie, because we lost the first two, but we won in the Supreme court, so they said, "They lost."
I guess, technically they're right, we lost when it didn't matter.
But we have it.
We have a great travel ban now for countries that are not countries where we want the people coming in.
Over the last three years, ICE officers have made over 380,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of over 145,000 assaults, 40,000 sex crimes and 5, 800 murders.
Over the last three years, border patrol and ICE have seized over two million pounds of fentanyl, heroin, meth, and other deadly narcotics.
And you see it all the time.
We stripped federal grant funding from deadly sanctuary cities.
They want to have a sanctuary city, not going to be like the old days.
We canceled the lawless policies of the previous administration and empowered border agents and ICE officers to do their jobs and proudly enforce the laws of the United States of America.
We removed 20,000 gang members, including 4,500, MS-13.
That's pretty good.
Who would ever think there's that many?
I entered into three landmark agreements with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala to end the abuse of the asylum system.
We cut down that payment that I was talking about substantially and they're still very happy and they are working with us very well and that includes Mexico.
Right now, Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our Southern border, helping us to guard our Southern border.
And we're giving you the tools to do the job that you signed up for.
That's what we've done.

I said, "No, no, we don't want them here.
We want them outside."
We got sued all over the place that we won.
So now they don't come into the United States, they can wait outside.
For the first time ever, the United States is now exercising our full legal authority to expedited removal.
We don't have to go through years and years of litigation.
You need Perry Mason to try and win.
We ended the Obama Biden policy of giving work permits to newly arriving, illegal aliens.
Think of that one.
We established the national vetting center, the most advanced visa screening system, anywhere in the world.
We know so much about the people coming in.
We know the good and we know the bad.
We've suspended refugee.
… Good and we know the bad.
We've suspended refugee resettlements from the world's most dangerous regions, because nothing is more important than keeping America safe.
To me, that's number one.
We've made historic progress to crack down on visa overstays.
You know all about that.
They overstay for years.
They say, "Maybe a night, maybe two nights."
Well, five years later, you catch them.
No, we ended it.
We issued strict sanctions on countries that failed to take back their own criminals.
We have many countries beyond the four that I mentioned, the three plus one, many countries.

Before, they weren't taking them back at all.
The last administration simply released these criminals.
We're making sure they go home and we're making sure they stay home.
We don't want them.

In January after the China virus, after the outbreak, after the outbreak, the China virus outbreak, it came from Wuhan, right?
I swiftly implemented a travel ban on China and I was criticized.
Biden, opposed the ban.
He said, "I oppose the ban."
He had no idea what the hell he was doing.
Why do you oppose it, Joe?
I don't know.
They told me to say that.
If we had listened to Sleepy Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional American lives would have been lost.
We did a good thing.
