There's tremendous energy in our nation.
Greatest nation in the world.
Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record.
Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring.
The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years.
And we've ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated.
Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year.
We've deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13.
Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country.
We've done more to secure the border than any administration in history.
We're building the wall, as I said, faster than ever.
It will soon be almost one new mile a day.
We're looking for that.
Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders.
How's he doing tonight?
132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover of the world.
Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan.
But if you don't mind, I'm not going to criticize it tonight.
Let them keep going and I'll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election.
Okay?
Because I don't want him to change.
Please don't change.
Same with the Green New Deal.
I don't want to talk about it, Doug, tonight.
I don't want to talk about it.
I came up with the name Pocahontas.
Too early.
But fortunately, she's self-destructed anyway.
Did you ever see a phony like that?
She's a phony.
She lost because she couldn't keep it straight on her own heritage.
She said she was an Indian.
I said, " I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none."
She said, "Oh," and she panicked.
She panicked, and she had a test.
You know the result, 1/124th.
I think I win the bet.
Somewhere along the line, I think I win.
No, she… I did it too early.
I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective.
She's essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things.
While the socialist Democrats are try- … one of those things.
While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare.
And that's what we're getting.
That's right.
One of the big secrets.
The Democrats won't let us say it.
They want to keep that as quiet as possible.
Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare.
And what we've done, we've gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you.
Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice.
We're making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it's better healthcare.
A lot of people don't know this.
People don't know this.
They think that's their issue.
It's not.
They failed on healthcare.
We're protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will.
And by the way, we're trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we're managing it incredibly, but we're trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions.
Remember that.
We're trying to get rid of it, but while we're having it, we're managing it really much better than they did.
Remember they built the $5 billion website?
Remember that?
It was supposed to cost $5 million.
It cost $5 billion.
$5 billion.
I mean, you could get a kid out of high school.
I have a son.
He's a young boy, 13.
He uses a computer.
He could have given them a healthcare site.
I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would've worked.
He's so good.
"Hi dad.
How you doing, dad?
How's it going?"
Bing, bing, bong.
I said, "Don't play with that while you're talking to me."
"What's going on, dad?"
These kids are incredible, right?
The kids, they make us look like babies with that.
But he could have given you a great site for about $2.
They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked.
By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa?
And I hear, I hear, I don't want to say it.
I don't want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do.
We don't have anything.
Nobody's running against us in so many states.
It's sort of nice.
We can save the thunder, right?
But I hear that in Nevada.
I'm hearing bad things about their vote count.
I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don't know what the hell they're doing.
I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa.
We had more votes than anybody's ever had as an incumbent president.
Same thing in New Hampshire.
It's a good sign.
It's a good sign.
By a lot.
By the way, by a lot.
But I'm hearing that, and I hope this isn't the case because I'd like to find out who the hell won.
We still don't know who won in Iowa.
I heard coming over here they're still working on the count.
No, no, no.
He said, "You won."
Yeah, I think we did win.
I think we did.
Very good.
That's very good.
I have to thank you, that one.
That's very good.
No, we did win.
Look, we are winning.
We're winning big.
We have fake polls out there.
These guys do fake polls.
They are fake polls.
I had a poll.
It's just like it was in 2016.
I'd hear these polls.
I'd hear women didn't like me, and I did great with women.
I hear everyone didn't like me.
Nobody liked me.
Nobody liked me.
And then we won.
Thank you, women.
Nobody liked me 2016.
No, no, I hear that.
Remember, women didn't like him, and at the end of that he did great with women.
He did great with this.
He did great with everybody.
We did great with everybody.
Remember, 306 to 223.
That's a slaughter.
That's a slaughter.
Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path.
There is no path, right, to 270?
I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there's no chance.
But I was at 269, so I went to Maine.
I love Maine.
I went to Maine.
Maine's cut in half.
And one Maine has one.
I went there four or five times.
People are great.
I won it.
And they were right.
There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306.
These people.
These people.
There is no path.
That's right, Doug.
They said there is no path, the fake news media.
"There is no path for Donald Trump."
And then they said the evening of the election, "It's going to be a really short night for Donald Trump.
Thank God, we got rid of this guy."
Because they did the exit polls going out, right?
And I was even told, but a lot of people didn't want to talk about it.
The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I'm not going to use that name because you'll kill me if I use it.
So I won't use it.
It's a much better story if I use it because that's the truth.
That's what they said.
"How did you vote?"
Usually, they say, "I voted for Clinton," or, "I voted for Trump."
Right?
"How'd you vote?"
"None of your business."
See, I'm being nice, right?
I'll keep it that way because otherwise we'll ruin the whole evening.
They'll say, "His language," right?
Even this tough guy in the front says, "I agree."
"How did you vote?"
"No, I don't want to tell you."
"How did you vote?"
"None of your damn business.
I'm not going to tell you."
"How did you vote?"
"I'm not … " And it was like this massive number, right?
Massive.
So everybody, they just didn't count that.
So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton.
They're looking unbelievable.
This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump.
We finally will be rid of this guy.
And then the numbers started coming in.
The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida.
Donald Trump has won the state of Florida.
And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I've ever seen.
And they knew something was going on because they didn't pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before.
Right?
In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, "I'll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks," even though they were no way near where my area was.
We were at a hotel in Midtown.
We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage.
It was shaped like the United States of America.
And by the end, it didn't look too good.
Did you ever see more unhappy people?
So they go, "Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida.
They go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
They outspent me like five to one.
Only negative ads.
They're all negative.
So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing.
She hated Donald Trump, but they said, "What the hell does she stand for?
What does she do?"
Every ad was a negative ad.
So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren't so good.
They can be effective.
But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads.
Everything was negative.
So nobody knew what the hell she spent.
You know, her husband said she was going to lose.
Her husband's a professional.
Her husband said, "You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I've ever seen.
You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary.
You better go to Wisconsin."
She said, "No, we haven't lost Wisconsin in 36 years".
"No, no, Hillary, you got to go there.
I'm telling you, I don't like what I saw."
"No, what do you know?"
He's a professional politician.
She wasn't.
It's one of those little problems in life.
So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina.
We won North Carolina.
Right?
And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot.
They refused, the fake news refused to call it.
I kept saying, "We won Pennsylvania.
Why don't they call it?"
It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they're crooked.
They are fake.
And I said, "Why don't they call Pennsylvania?"
But some beautiful things happened.
And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever.
The great, great, great state of Ohio.
Remember?
Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, "Well, nobody can win.
Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio."
And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big.
We knew we were going to win it.
And now we're up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why?
We're bringing back jobs.
We're bringing back factories.
Everybody's working.
Nobody's ever had a better year than we've been having.
And we've been doing it for a long time, right?
Almost from the beginning.
And don't let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression.
We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on.
And I'll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts.
We freed up our nation to go back to work.
True.
So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they're pouring back in.
The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin's doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking.
You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products.
Okay?
So what happens is this, we're working on healthcare.
We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing.
I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast.
We've approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction.
We've totally transformed veteran's healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done.
And we passed the spectacular right to try.
So if you're in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena's in trouble, but if you're in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs.
You get it.
And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives.
It's incredible what's happening.
People would go to Europe.
They'd go to Asia.
If they had no money, they'd go home and die.
Now they have the right to use our drugs before they're approved.
Think of that.
Doesn't have the power.
Doesn't have the staying power.
You see what's happening in California.
Blackouts, rolling blackouts.
How would you like that in Pennsylvania?
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Darling, what's wrong?
I can't watch Trump on television.
I can't watch our president.
Darling, we have a rolling blackout.
It'll only be a few hours.
I think we'll be on by two o'clock in the morning, darling, and we can watch a rerun.
Now, this is what's happening.
You have rolling blackouts.
You have, in some cases, just blackouts.
I don't even call them rolling.
Not going to happen to your state.
Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the largest investment in your state's history.
That was all made possible by our pro energy policies.
We've done it a lot.
In Louisiana, we're building some of the largest plants you've ever seen, largest in the world and it's incredible, all related to energy, but your security and your jobs are in very grave peril, because the radical left maniacs, they don't want to have anything to do with energy.
They don't want anything to do with, they have different concepts, right?
They have the green new deal, whether it will be no energy, almost of any kind.
No, it's crazy.
Thought of by AOC plus three.
You know AOC?
and she's got them.
She's radical left, but she's not as bad as some of them.
How about Omar of Minnesota?
We're going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say.
He's telling us how to run our country.
How did you do where you came from?
How is your country doing?
She's going to tell us, she's telling us how to run our country.
You know what?
The Democrats in Congress, you have to see what they are doing.
Their stance on Israel, it's like a whole different world.
It's like from 10 years ago, it's like a different world and we want to keep our world the way it was and the way it's going to be.
We've got the greatest country on earth and we're going to keep it that way.
We don't need socialist and we don't need communist telling us how to run our country.
I do this every night and a lot of times it's a waste.
I did it last night.
We were … Did you see the crowd we had last night?
We were in a great place, Ohio.
We had a crowd.
We had a crowd.
You couldn't see the end of it.
I said, "Turn around camera, turn around."
But, they never liked doing that, you know?
They don't like spinning those cameras.
They don't want to show the crowd.
They don't like showing.
They don't like showing, show the crowd and this is … it's an honor.
Let me tell you.
Look, I used to think that was a difficulty like it was a new camera that can't turn, but then whenever there was like a problem, like there'd be a little argument or some kind of an anti-Trump person, you don't see that much.
I don't want to bring it on, but you don't see it much anymore.
You know why?
It's dangerous.
It's dangerous for them, but you know, I'd see the camera would never move, whenever where there's something like a little negative happening, that thing would turn around like a pretzel.
I said, "Oh, it does move."
But, they never want to show the crowds.
They never, last night.
Now, I went home and I tell you this, I go home all the time.
First lady, "How'd you like the crowd?"
Sir, I didn't see it.
I didn't see it, but I didn't see it, Donald.
I didn't see it.
Sometimes she'll call me Mr. President, but she's only kidding.
Believe me.
She's only kidding.
Has she been a great first lady, right?
She's been a great first lady and very popular.
She's really done a great job.
She works hard.
We have some great people here tonight.
I brought certain members of my family, but I'm going to introduce them to you in a little bit, okay?
Great family.
They work hard.
I'll tell you what, they work hard.
They really work hard.
But I do wish they would show because it would be, you know, it's actually better for them if they show.
It shows the importance.
The only thing you can do is show.
I'll say, "How did it look?"
I don't know how it looked, but the sound was phenomenal.
Okay?
It sounded like a Penn state football game like the Steelers football game.
You can't disguise it.
You ever see Sleepy Joe with the little circles?
Oh, you can.
He puts them very far away, so far away.
Then he comes up with the mask.
He's like a hundred yards from the nearest human being.
He's got a … He feels good about the mask.
I wonder in the debate it'll be him and I or the stage.
Is he going to walk in with a mask?
No, I think he'll come in with a mask.
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Well, the question is, will he leave it on during the debate?
Because it's a little hard and I'm all for mask when you need them, I'm up, but when you're making a speech and the nearest person's like where you are and you're in a stage all by yourself and then he had a habit of taking it off and it hangs down on his ear as he's speaking, it makes him feel comfortable.
Honestly, whatever makes you feel good is okay with me, but it'll be interesting.
I'm going to be, we're going to have a big rating on that.
He's been doing it all his life.
He's been doing it for 47 years and I've just started doing this stuff.
I'm just starting.
But, I'm just thinking, but I did it more in 47 months than he did in 47 years.
That's true.
That's true.
You look at what we've done.
No, it's true.
That's actually true.
He did a lot of negative stuff too.
You have to deduct that out.
When asked if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking in a Biden administration, Joe replied, "No, we would make sure that it's all eliminated."
All of a sudden, he gets the nomination.
He's been trying to get the nomination for decades.
He finally get, and that was prime time for him, which was never great.
He never got more than 1%.
We called it.
Remember, I called him his first nickname was 1% Joe.
Frankly, had Elizabeth Warren been loyal to her philosophy, which is radical left, socialism, perhaps communism.
I don't know, perhaps.
It's verging on communism, right?
But had she been loyal, she would've left.
She would have quit.
She had no chance.
She was out.
Pocahontas.
She was gone.
Remember, I said, " I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none."
I'd love to have some, but I don't happen to have any.
Then she choked and she went out and got a test.
She announced she had 1024th, right?
1,000.
That means, like I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's okay.
Seven, 800 years ago, maybe.
What a phony she is.
It's terrible.
Now, we're going to pick a great woman, any one of the five that I told you, but any one of the women that we had they're all great people, great scholars, great, brilliant people.
A lot of people.
00 on Saturday at the White House.
You see, we have tremendous Republican support.
Two people.
Always got to be two.
Always got to be the two.
Those two.
We have great support from the Republican party, tremendous support.
It's never been this unified before ever, ever and the fake impeachment.
We had 196 to nothing Republican support.
We had 52 and a half to a half in the Senate.
Who is the half?
I can't imagine.
I can't.
Buddy was very good today.
I have to tell you, he was good.
Now, I'm happy.
Thank you, Mitt.
Thank you.
No, he was very good, very positive statement, but days ago, Biden reiterated his pledge to require net zero carbon emissions.
That's basically saying, you know what that is?
There'll be no more oil.
There'll be no more gas.
There'll be no more nothing.
There'll be no more industry.
There'll be no more country.
That's what it's like really.
That would instantly shut down all fracking and all mining immediately in Pennsylvania sending your jobs overseas, sending your money to somebody else, not you.
I'll keep your jobs in Pennsylvania where they belong and you're going to be doing fracking for a long time.
I can say the same because you are really big in energy.
I can say the same thing to you as I say in Texas.
So, they don't want oil.
They don't want fracking, right?
They don't want the energy that we know that powers these massive plants because the other stuff is wonderful.
It's not going to do it.
It's not going to do it.
So, they don't like oil.
They don't like the gas.
They don't like God, religion, churches are close.
How about these states?
They still have churches closed.
By the way, your governor hasn't been so great.
You know that, right?
Are your churches still closed?
They're still closed.
They're doing it for a reason.
By the way, November 4th, they'll announce, "We've decided to open up."
Okay?
They're trying to make our numbers as bad as possible.
So, California's closed.
Pennsylvania's closed.
North Carolina's closed.
Michigan is closed.
That's another beauty right there, Michigan's closed.
Then they have these fake ballots, millions and millions of ballots.
By the way, when not if, when you see shenanigans, please report it to your authorities.
Okay?
The real authorities, they're watching and the authorities are watching, but please report it.
But when you look at it, really, it's amazing.
They're trying to make our numbers look bad, but even with numerous closed states and you notice also law and order, right?
Law and order, the red states, the Republican states, they're working great.
Record low crime, record low, but Democrat run states, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, New York has gone through a … We have to bring back.
We should draft Rudy Giuliani.
Okay?
Let's bring him back.
Draft Rudy.
We want Rudy.
Rudy, Rudy.
I'll tell you Rudy is amazing, but he did a great job.
New York was in big trouble.
He came in and he just was tough, smart, and it became the safest big city.
Now, we have a man where some categories of crime were up 300%.
He fired 1,000.
He fired a lot of police, I guess, a billion dollars a year worth of police, worth of great police, firemen and women.
It's a terrible thing.
I love that place so much and it's so sad to see what's happening to New York.
We're going to make a little bit of a play for New York.
In theory, the Democrats automatically win New York, but I do phenomenally in most parts.
Then one part, it's automatic, but I can't imagine that particular part is going to be very happy.
So, we're going to make a play for New York.
With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play.
We've got Pennsylvania.
Just go out of here.
We don't have to make a play.
We don't have to.
It's a great, you know, for years though Pennsylvania was a place that Republicans just didn't win.
For many years, everybody thought they were going to win, every Republican.
So yeah, we're going to win Pennsylvania.
They thought they were going to win it and they didn't.
I came along and we won it and we won it quite easily.
Quite easy.
I think we're going to do even better now, because remember, number one in the history of your state last year, and that's because of what we did, we stopped the dumping.
We saved your stell.
So many different things, but Pennsylvania is the home of American energy.
Think of it that way.
This has taken place over a very short period of time.
Also, the birthplace of a thing called the American constitution.
Right?
American constitution.
To uphold our constitution as written as opposed to as conceived by some radical left judge, I will soon be announcing that nominee.
You're going to love it.
You're going to be so happy.
If you don't love it, don't vote for me.
Okay?
You don't like it.
My opponent refuses to release a list of justices.
I was told that a big thing when I was running last time, nobody really knew me.
They knew me very well.
We had great success at The Apprentice and in business and it was great, but they never knew what kind of a judge I would pick or to be a justice, right?
A justice of the Supreme Court.
I said, "I mean, what am I going to do?
How am I going to solve that problem?"
But, I was in politics, never.
Don't forget, when I ran, they said, "No, he's inexperienced."
I ran against some very talented people.
Some of whom are very good friends of mine.
Some of whom I don't like too much.
When I don't like somebody, it last for a long time, but I said, "Well, how do we solve that problem?"
I don't know.
They just weren't believing.
The appointment of a- Just weren't believing.
The appointment of a United States Supreme Court justice was much more important to the voters than I thought.
And they're right, because they will set policy for 50 years and they'll set policy, whether it's life, whether it's second amendment.
The second amendment, if I weren't president, you know the pressure, your second amendment would be obliterated.
It would maybe be gone, but at a minimum obliterated, they haven't touched your second amendment.
Not even touched it.
Because I'm here to block.
I'm a blocking force.
I'm like a lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
I'm a blocking force.
No, they haven't touched it.
But your second amendment would be under siege.
So nobody knew.
I never knew.
You hear about Supreme Court, you know about Supreme Court, you know about other judges, by the way at the end of the first term, we'll be close to 300 federal judges, including court of appeals, which I think is a record.
I guess it's a record.
It's a lot.
That's a lot.
Nobody's done that.
It's record.
Think of that.
300.
That's a big percentage of the entire judiciary.
Think of that.
300.
And many, many court of appeals judges, but two great Supreme Court judges or justices.
And now we're going to get a third.
Can you imagine our enemies?
Three in one term.
So many presidents, they just don't have the chance and it's so important.
But I said to my people, I said, so if they don't believe me, what I'll do is I'll make up a list of 25 judges or people and we'll tell them, "I will only pick from that list."
They said, "That sounds like an interesting idea."
This was my idea.
When you've never run for office before you have to have a little bit of imagination.
So I got out a list, I named the people, the people are good, and I said, "And I promise that I will pick someone like the people on this list."
And it didn't work.
It went nowhere because they didn't trust it.
They said, "We want you to pick the people on the list, not somebody like the people on the list."
So I went back the next week, I said, "I will pick somebody that's on this list."
And they were all great, great judges for the most part, I think almost entirely, but judges and really respected conservative believers in our country, solid, incredible people.
And as soon as I did that, things went through the roof.
It was amazing how important it was.
By the way, would you stand up with that beautiful jacket?
I love this guy.
How many times- How many events?
He's been to a couple.
That's really great.
Thank you very much.
I've seen him before.
He's been here a couple of times, like about 90.
Thank you, man.
That's really nice.
I'm going to get one of those jackets.
By the way, the wall.
The wall, yeah, 330 miles.
330 miles.
330 miles.
And yes, we have a great relationship with Mexico.
First they said, "He'll never be able to build it."
The Democrats were just brutal.
I made a terrible mistake, I said it last night, I should have said, "We will not under any circumstances build a wall at our Southern border."
They would have given me all the money in the world.
But stupidly, I said, "We will build a wall."
And the Democrats said, "Let's not give it to him."
But we got it, we won.
We won court cases, we won court cases.
I won so much money we could build four walls if we wanted.
So then they said, "All right, all right."
They've lost.
So by the way, we're up to 330, the exact wall.
Their dream choice.
I said to the border patrol, I love these people, they're great, ICE, the border patrol, what they do is incredible.
They're incredible.
I said, "Give me your dream wall, as long as we're building we might as well build a wall that you want.
Let's build it right."
"Sir, we have to have vision.
We need steel and concrete."
I said, "How about one or the other?"
They said, "No, sir, we need steel and concrete.
We need steel.
Inside those poles we have rebar and we have concrete and they're 30 feet tall.
We need all sorts of things.
We need them to be wired."
I won't tell you why they're wired, but they're wired for a reason.
They're all wired up and they're incredible.
But you know what?
We got the wall.
Nobody could have done it.
So once we had the wall and it started going up and then we hit a hundred miles, 200 miles, now we're at 330, and we're building 10 miles a week and it'll be finished very soon.
And we have the most secure border in terms of drug trafficking, trafficking coming along and we've done phenomenally well.
Because that's a lot of the territory that we need.
We're going to go up to probably a little bit over 500 miles, so we're at 330.
But once they saw that I had it, they said, "Yeah, but Mexico's not paying for it."
But they are paying for it, Mexico's paying for the wall.
They are paying for it.
They're paying at the border.
They're paying for the wall.
All those trucks that go back and forth.
They're paying for the wall.
So the Democrats said, "Yeah, but Mexico…", they always have to find something, right?
And do you remember what I used to say that if they fight us, remember people would say, "What happens if they fight you on the wall?
What happens if they fight you right to hell on the wall?"
I said, "The wall would get 10 feet taller."
Took a little hit on that, we took a little bit of a hit, but that's okay.
The wall is a tall sucker, you don't want to get up to the top.
They look down, they say, "Oh, ye, ye, how do we get down off this?"
It's tall and it's strong and it's great.
And we appreciate, because Mexico has been working with us very closely.
They have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border making sure that people don't come into our country.
I want to thank the president of Mexico.
Very helpful.
So I made this list of potential justices and I'll tell you, it all changed.
Now I'm asking sleepy Joe Biden to give me a list and he doesn't want to do it.
You know why?
Because he can only put super radical left judges on, people that would destroy our country, people that would destroy your country.
And he knows that he's not electable… He shouldn't be electable anyway.
This is the worst candidate.
You know where he is today?
They have a thing called the LID.
I don't even know.
Do you know what LID stands for?
LID.
He put out a LID today early in the morning.
LID means he's not going to be anywhere today.
I'm working my ass off, I'm in Ohio, I'm in Texas, I'm in Florida, I'm in Michigan, I'm in Wisconsin.
Man.
Thank you.
That's so nice.
Well, that is something that one of the fake news reporters back there, they said they've never heard of that one.
"There was a chant that's going over the last six or seven rallies saying, ‘We love you.'"
That's never happened to a politician before.
Am I a politician?
I don't want to be a politician.
I don't think of myself as a politician.
But it really is, I appreciate it.
I've never heard it.
I liked Ronald Reagan, but they never said we love you, or maybe they did.
They're going to try and find out.
Then they'll say, "President Trump lied last night because 40 years ago I remember…" But no, nobody's ever heard that one before and I appreciate it because it is reciprocal.
Thank you very much.
Reciprocal.
Reciprocal love.
It's reciprocal.
I had such a nice life before I did this.
I had such a nice life.
Then I had the witch hunt that goes on forever.
It goes on.
And then we catch them spying on our campaign.
How about that?
Let's see what happens though.
But we caught them spying, all of that, the whole big deal.
And then the guys that were doing the investigation, they have their 31 different phones, they were accidentally wiped clean.
31 different phones, I think it was like 19 different people, and they all did the same exact accident.
Which if you knew anything about phones, it's almost an impossibility to do it once.
Let alone 31 different times.
So we caught them and that's called obstruction.
We have to remember that's called obstruction.
That was the Mueller group.
That was a Mueller group.
All those phones, they were wiped so clean.
And Hillary got a subpoena on the 30.
I said, "Forget about these things because you'll find them.
They have them.
They're in the state department."
I have no doubt about it, they're in the state department but they'll get them.
But you know what?
33,000, they have a request from the US Congress, that's not bad, US Congress they send a subpoena, very, very important, and after getting the subpoena, she deleted all of her emails and acid washed, and then she took her telephones.
I've gotten rid of phones too.
I throw them away.
She took cameras and she beat the hell out of them with a hammer and then threw them away.
And they found a couple of them.
She was very angry, obviously, if she did the hammer work.
But if anyone else said this, there's a protection, there's a dual level of justice, but we're getting down to the bottom of it because it's not fair to us.
Not fair to us.
33,000 emails.
She deleted them on the basis that it was all about her daughter's wedding, Chelsea, and also yoga classes.
33,000 emails on yoga and a wedding.
I don't think so.
And Comey said, "Oh, that's okay.
That sounds like a good reason."
That's Comey.
That's another beauty right there that Comey.
But we caught him, we caught him.
Very smart move.
Getting rid of that guy was a smart move, but we caught him.
Listen, we caught him.
They were spying on the campaign, they were doing actually worse than that.
Nobody's ever done a thing like this, so let's see what happens.
But we caught him cold, we got so much stuff.
Remember the insurance policy, right?
From Strzok and Page, two lovers.
They were very smart.
They would use the public servers and send it over the public wires because they didn't want to be caught having an affair.
So they went over the public.
That was a very good thing for us.
Wasn't it? "
Darling, darling, darling, please.
She's going to win.
She's going to win, isn't she?
Peter, Peter only you can save us.
Peter, she's going to win.
Yes, darling.
She's going to win.
I know.
100,000 to nothing."
Remember that?
It was actually 100 million to one.
This was a hundred million to one.
This is this idiot.
So listen, "So darling, please, please tell me again.
Yes, 100 million to one she's going to win.
But just in case she doesn't, we have an insurance policy."
Now that only means one thing.
And we went through the insurance policy and we caught them.
So let's see what happens to these treasonous crooks.
These terrible people.
And they put our nation through turmoil.
But I just want to thank… A lot of people were very unfairly treated.
You look at General Flynn, look, he's still going through it.
Can you believe it?
But a lot of people were unfairly treated by a bunch of treasonous, horrible people.
And they used the intelligence agencies of our country to try and steal an election and to try and do a coup.
Wouldn't you think?
Who would ever think this country… But that's all you can say.
Some people would say, "Well, that's a conspiracy theory."
No, just take a look at the records.
For me, it's a very exciting thing because we found something that nobody would have thought possible.
Now let's see what happens.
But we have them cold, they spied on our campaign.
It's our campaign And if you want to save America, you have to go out, get out and vote.
This is the most important election.
In just three and a half years we've secured America's borders, which makes them very unhappy, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, we built the military.
It was totally depleted when I took over.
We built a military.
Two and a half trillion dollars we spent, all made in the USA, the greatest equipment, the greatest planes and rockets and missiles and our nuclear.
I hate to even mention the word and hope to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful weapons in the history of the world.
And we did that over a very short period of time.
Weapons that are so powerful that we're the envy of the world, but I never want to use those weapons.
And hopefully we'll never have to.
You know the way you don't have to use them, is when you have them.
It's when you have them.
But nobody's ever built force like what we have.
And the newspapers and the press and the fake news they went and said, "He just gave away classified information!"
I said, "No, I will look you right in the eye," first of all, I'm allowed to do it, I'm the president, so I'm allowed to actually.
I'm the only one that's allowed to.
But no, no, I didn't give away.
I'm just telling you, most powerful weapons ever produced we have, and other countries know that.
And it's a good thing that they know it and I don't think we'll ever be using them.
And I hope we don't.
I hope to God.
I use the word God, because they refuse to use the word God in their pledge of allegiance, right?
Twice.
I use the word God.
I hope to God, we never have to use them.
But I obliterated the ISIS caliphate, which was all over the place.
100%.
Remember I got it down to 99%.
They said, "You got to go a hundred."
I said, "Let's get out of here.
We're bringing them all back home.
Everyone's coming back home."
Long, long wars.
The never ending wars, the endless wars.
We fixed our disastrous trade deals, they were a disaster, brought jobs and factories back to Pennsylvania under 16 years.
And think of this, for 16 years presidents, Obama, President Bush, household income rose $2,945.
That's over a 16 year period.
In three years, your household income rose almost $10,000.
When you include energy.
You have to include energy.
Without energy, almost $7,000.
But we have to include energy.
I mean, how much are you paying for your gasoline?
You never saw $2 gasoline.
Less, right?
It's less.
They go up, it's less.
It's a big difference.
What is it nowadays?
Come on, tell me.
I haven't got any gas.
I haven't stopped recently at a gas station.
15?
Okay.
Because for a while it was way under two.
And we're going to keep it there.
We have so much, we have so much.
In my first three years we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction in the history of our country, by far.
We built the greatest economy in the history of the world.
And right now we're doing it again.
I see all these hats, Make America Great Again.
And now I'm going to say this, Make America Great Again, Again.
Make America Great Again, Again, Again.
We saved 1.4 million jobs in Pennsylvania alone and to fight the China virus, it's the China virus, not the coronavirus.
Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place.
It's corona.
No, it's the China virus.
They don't want to say it.
The radical left, they don't want to say it.
You ever notice they're always going to have to Russia.
Look, nobody's been tougher on Russia than me.
"Russia, Russia, Russia."
I said, "What about China?"
They never going to to mention it.
They got little deals going on I think.
But coronavirus, doesn't it sound like Italy?
A beautiful villa.
Corona.
No, it's a China virus.
They should have stopped it.
To fight the China virus we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II.
We did an A+ job, except we did a D job in terms of public relations, explaining it because we were too busy doing it.
But the fact is they wouldn't have written it anyway.
It didn't matter to them.
It's there.
It's their little thing.
You have a watch Biden?
He can't talk about it he thinks, so he gets up, "The coronavirus," they say, "We want to talk about Supreme Court judge today."
Well, I don't know about that.
"The coronavirus."
And he doesn't know we did a great job, he has no clue.
He said, "I should have opened."
He goes, "I should have shut down one week earlier."
What he doesn't say is he did the worst job in the history of an epidemic or a pandemic with the swine flu.
It was a joke.
And what he did, his own man, that was in charge said recently, "We had no idea what the hell we were doing.
It was a total disaster."
There were amateurs.
And now he tells us how to do something that's far more lethal.
But he said, " They should have closed one week early," except when it came to closing the border, which I did, which turned out to save tens of thousands of lives, Biden criticized me until two months later when he said I was right.
But we should have closed a weak earlier.
Think of that.
We pioneered lifesaving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April.
Think of that.
Remdesivir, the plasmas, we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country.
Nobody knows that.
And I am devastated to see it happening, but you see what's going on in Europe again.
They were always saying, "Oh, Europe is doing better."
Actually we did better, but now Europe has a big spike, a big spike.
So they're not talking about that.
The number of hospitalized virus patients is down by 47% and virus patients coming to the emergency room is down and visits are way down, visits to hospital.
Europe has almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States.
They're liking to compare us to Europe.
50% greater excess mortality rate.
Our early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through Operation Warp Speed.
You've heard about it, they don't want to talk about it.
What we've done in a record period of time with the ventilators, now we're building ventilators for the world.
Very hard to do.
We'll develop and distribute a vaccine very, very shortly in record time, it would have been two or three years, four years, if Biden's group had done it, but we've done a great job with the FDA in clearing a path and you'll be seeing it very shortly.
And these are great companies that are doing it.
So we'll crush the virus and our opponents will, with him, they will crush America.
We can't let it happen.
This country is too great.
Our love of each other is too great.
This guy doesn't know he's alive.
He really doesn't.
He doesn't know he's alive.
He did an ad on an anonymous source that said about me making a statement about military soldiers that died.
And it was such a disgusting thing.
I said, "The only good thing about it is now I can take the gloves off."
This guy doesn't have a clue.
He doesn't know where the hell he is and they'll give him a shot of something.
I don't know, he's going to get something.
Because I watched him so badly, he performed so badly in the debates, and then with Bernie, he was average, not great, but he got through and I said, "What the hell is he taking?"
And we'd like to ask him.
And I said that, "We want a drug test, we want a drug test.
We'll both take it.
We'll both take it."
Because with Bernie he was able to get through.
But listen, it wasn't Winston Churchill.
This wasn't the greatest, but he got through, it was fine.
Him and Bernie screaming at each other, mostly Bernie.
Crazy Bernie.
He's not too happy.
I'll tell you, did you ever see a better loser than Bernie though?
Seriously.
He's a good loser.
He got terribly treated by Hillary and that group.
And then it happened again with Elizabeth Warren, right?
It happened again.
What the Democrat party did to him.
And then you have this guy, Mike Bloomberg, mini Mike, one question and he was gone.
There goes 1.8 billion out their window.
I said, "You think it's easy up here, Mike, don't ya?"
One question and that was the end.
He said, "Where am I?
Get me the hell off of this platform."
Mini Mike, mini Mike.
So now he's trying to buy into the party.
You would think after the way they treated him, they called him every name, Pocahontas destroyed him, she didn't do good against me, but boy did she do good against Mini Mike.
I figured he'd be calling and saying, "Listen, I want to become a Republican."
We've done great for the economy, you'd think.
But he always wanted to run for president, and he tried before, I guess, but he tried and it was a bad experience.
And you would think he would have joined our party.
But instead he's trying to buy his way back in.
When somebody treats you that way, even stay neutral, don't go back in.
He wants to give them a lot of money to try and buy their friendship.
And one thing you learned about politics, I spent a fraction of the money that crooked Hillary spent.
They raised $2 billion.
I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money… I spent my own money, but I spent a fraction of the money, like 35%, 30%, and we won.
Nobody ever says that.
It's not about money.
It's about other things.
There are other things involved.
It's not just about money.
In the old days, my father would teach me, "If you can win and spend less, that's a good thing."
I remember after I won and I won decisively look, 306 to 223.
That's a lot.
306 delegates, 306, that's decisive.
We won Michigan and we're going to win it again.
We're up in a poll just now.
Oh, they're going crazy.
They're going crazy.
We won Wisconsin.
We won Pennsylvania.
But my father taught me.
He said, "If you can win and spend less money, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
That's a good thing, not a bad thing."
Like if you get along with the leaders of other lands and don't go to war all the time with everybody and can come out on top without having to shed blood all over the place and destroy your families and your country, like when I get along with Putin, when I get along with Kim Jong-un.
Whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with North Korea?
Nothing happened.
They said I gave away so much.
I said, "What did I give away?"
They couldn't find that anything.
I didn't do anything.
They said, "You met."
"Oh, I met.
Oh, okay.
I met."
Now you would have been in war with her.
You would have been in war.
But if you can spend, think of this, if you can spend less money and win, that's a good thing.
So after I won one of these people back there, right back there- … in order to keep the thing going on Trump, I had won, he said, "But Trump raised substantially less money than crooked Hillary Clinton."
That's because I didn't need the money.
I didn't need the money.
I can call up a lot of rich guys that raised a lot of money, but I feel uncomfortable doing it because when you do that, it's like you're sort of … It's not the same.
I could call up every guy.
They call me up and they say, "Sir, how are you, sir?
Mr. President, sir."
I have friends see.
I don't have too many friends up because I used to be comfortable.
You have to be comfortable with people, right?
I have friends, I have one friend, Richard.
I talk about him all the time, but multiply this times a hundred people.
Richard used to call me up five, six years ago.
"Hey, let's have dinner."
"All right.
Where do you want to go?"
"I don't know.
Go to some crazy restaurant."
Today the restaurants are all closed in New York.
They don't want to open them.
They want to make them do badly until November but don't worry, they're opening in November 4th.
But it's true.
So, it's Richard on the phone, Richard, my friend for many, many years.
I said, "Hey Richard, how are you doing?"
"Mr. President sir, how are you?"
I said, "Well … " He's been calling Donnie and Don and DJ, and all.
"Richard, are you okay?
Everything good?"
"Yes, sir.
Mr. President, sir.
You're doing a great job and I'd like to thank you."
"Good, Richard.
Richard, loosen up please.
You don't have to call me Mr.
Parson."
I said, "Just call me Donald.
It's okay."
"Thank you Donald.
I really appreciate it."
And you hear the guy can't breathe.
He's having a hard time breathing.
He's very nervous.
Then at the end of the phone, he goes, "Mr. President again, thank you so much for the job you do," and he hangs up.
I said, how can you be friends with … ?
It just doesn't work.
It's like, I've lost a lot of people this way.
It's called respect for the office.
They have respect for the office.
They really do.
Nothing wrong with it.
I sort of understand that.
They have respect for the office.
Nobody has more respect for this offices than I do.
That's why I'm doing a great job, and I'll always do a great job.
It's respect for the office.
But on November 3rd, Pennsylvania, will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity just like we were before, or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn't have a clue, to kill the recovery, raise your taxes, delay the vaccine.
So he wants to impose a $4 trillion tax.
Do you believe?
4 trillion.
Ban American energy, which means what?
Hey, let's go back.
Let's call up the Middle East and let's be real nice to them because we need their energy.
No, thank you.
Destroy your suburbs.
You know, I got rid of this regulation that was going to destroy your suburbs.
Destroy your suburbs.
I call it the Obama Regulates.
They're building nice projects right next to your beautiful home.
Lots of luck.
Give free healthcare.
I hope the people in the suburbs … When I did this, I took a lot of heat.
I got rid of a regulation.
They all said, "Sir, we'll amend the regulation.
We're going to amend it."
I said, "I don't want to amend it."
A couple of stories where written.
I wish the women living in the suburbs would read these stories.
They were written by people that say, "I can't believe a president had the guts to do it."
I did because I want to save the American dream.
By the way, a big part of the American dream are minorities who made it and they want to live in the suburbs and they don't want to be next to a project.
Remember?
Sleepy Joe.
He'll do it because he has no choice because they have total power.
He's like a puppet for them and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies.
To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission.
We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and getting better every single day.
We're not going to let it fail.
The Democrat party has joined forces with flag burners, anarchists, anti-police people, they're extremist.
Agitators.
And then they say, "Oh no, no, this was a peaceful protest.
This is a peaceful protest."
They know what I'm talking about.
They know our great uniform.
Brilliant.
We love them, but you know what?
We call it a peaceful protest now, because the only thing you're allowed to do in Pennsylvania, can't go to church, right?
You can't meet, you can't congregate.
You can't look at each other.
You can't give your wife a kiss goodnight.
You've got to wear a mask.
You can't do anything.
They got you closed up.
"Don't go out to dinner, stay where you are."
Michigan, same thing like the governor.
Her husband went boating.
It was a disaster because nobody's allowed.
He was the only boat.
He had this massive, beautiful lake.
You know the lake I'm talking about.
It's a big lake.
They've got to be able to do their job.
You've got to let them do their job.
Got to be able to do your job, right?
They let you do your job, you'd see.
You'd see Pennsylvania, not some big, bad crime numbers in your state.
You let them do your job.
Any state, New York's finest.
By the way, I got endorsed by New York's finest.
First time they've ever endorsed.
And you know that's hard when you have radical left running the city, all politicians, the mayor.
I got endorsed by the Chicago Police.
Can you imagine that?
I got endorsed by Oklahoma and I got endorsed by Texas and Louisiana.
I got endorsed by Florida, the sheriffs.
All the sheriffs got together, they endorsed Trump.
I got endorsed by law enforcement, everybody.
But how could you possibly endorse people that hate you and don't respect the job you do, and don't let you do your job most importantly?
Because if they let you do what you do better than anybody else in the world, you wouldn't have problems.
These are other police departments.
You look at Seattle.
We said we're going in, and they immediately said, "We'll put up our hands."
It was so easy.
We were going in the following day.
You look at Portland.
How about Portland?
It's like an anarchist's dream.
We're dealing with the governor, because you know, I hate to say it, but they're all Democrat-run cities and states.
All of them, every single one.
The Republicans are doing great, but they have to ask.
By law, they have to ask us to go in.
But do you remember that beautiful day?
It was 10 days late.
You had these people from CNN and other places.
"These are friendly protests."
That's a lovely thing to say.
As he's getting rocks and cans of tuna fish.
They go out to buy tuna fish and soup.
You know that, right?
Goya.
I hope Goya, he's great, isn't he?
Good guy.
They go out and buy Goya because they throw it.
They throw it.
It's the perfect weight, tuna fish they can really rip it, and that hits you.
No, it's true.
Bumblebee brand tuna, and you can throw it at soccer, you can a curve on it.
You can do whatever else you want.
The cops in Chicago, you saw, they're going like this.
It was terrible.
They're not allowed to fight back.
They're not allowed to fight back.
These guys if they fight back, nobody's going to be there very long throwing things.
But they're professionals, they're anarchists.
They're paid for by outside stupid rich people that … They're stupid people.
By the way, you know the first ones that get wiped out?
They don't have a shot by the way, I'll tell you that, but if they ever did, the first ones that would get wiped out are the stupid people that gave them the money to do this stuff.
Those are the people that would get wiped out.
But you know, they're very smart.
Everything is perfect.
Do you ever see where they drop the bricks along the thing in a bag?
Then they drop, everyone picks them up, throws them at our great police.
We're not going to let that stuff happen, but this is all a Democrat.
It doesn't happen with Republicans.
I was with Greg Abbott.
I was with Ron DeSantis, Texas and Florida and other governors that can't even believe a thing like that could happen, but they get caught.
They're walking up.
There're like 30 cans of soup.
They have like 25 cans of tuna.
They get caught.
"I'm bringing this home to my family.
How dare you stop me?"
No, no, no.
They use it as ammunition.
It's terrible shame.
But he went down and he didn't like it.
He was hit.
"Police brutality."
You remember that?
They walked in, and they've got the tear gas.
They've got everything you can possibly have.
Pepper spray.
They don't want you to use tear gas anymore.
In some places like I think in Milwaukee, they said no tear gas, no pepper spray.
How the hell do you keep big crowds back?
You can't.
So the police all quit.
They all quit.
They said, "We can't do it."
But you remember, they went out and you had one, then you had two, three, four, then you had five, six, seven.
All of a sudden they started pouring in.
They were getting off the buses.
They came from a different locale, and then you had a line of them and there was no social distancing unfortunately.
In fact, I was going to turn them in because they were right next to each other.
They were right next to each other.
They were touching arms and they had big, strong arms like these guys right over here.
There were big strong guys.
That's all right.
They were like together.
Then you saw the first line.
Then you saw the second line, then you saw a third line, and then you saw a fourth line.
Then they said, "March."
They never halted.
Just walked right through, cleaned everything up, and Minneapolis was cured.
They were cured.
They grabbed them.
They grabbed them.
They grabbed them.
They were grabbing them left and right.
Sometimes they grabbed, they grabbed one guy, "I'm a reporter.
I'm a reporter."
"Get out of here."
They throw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn.
But no, but I mean, honestly, when you watch the crap that we've all had to take so long, when you see that, it's actually … You don't want to do that, but when you see it, it's actually a beautiful sight.
It's a beautiful sight.
Behind him was like 10 blocks of fire was … I'd never.
It's a classic.
I don't know.
Anybody, you know what I'm talking about?
Is it … So, I just have such respect, but you have to let these great professionals do what they do best.
You have to let them do what they … It's called law and order.
We need law and order.
So, Democrat phenomena.
If they win, Sleepy Joe, if they win, because he has no power over these people, these people are crazed lunatics.
If they win, your cities will be like this.
You'll lose all rights.
Your constitution will be worthless.
It'll be a terrible, terrible thing.
I'm not even sure that, after some time listening to that and going along with it, I'm not even sure the country can ever recover.
That's how bad it would be.
I'm not sure it could ever recover.
Over Labor Day.
Left-wing radicals rampaged through Pittsburgh, harassing diners at restaurants.
I saw that one.
That was horrible.
No, I saw that, right?
I saw that.
That one guy grabs a woman, a older woman, she's eating a steak.
He grabbed the steak and started eating it, then he threw it back on the plate.
An outdoor place, and her husband standing there like they're afraid for their lives.
It was a terrible thing, and should never be allowed to happen.
A thing like that should just be closed up before it ever gets started.
That was terrible.
Remember that?
An older woman.
Last week after a police officer shot a knife-wielding assailant, over 100 rioters rampaged in Lancaster.
Went to school right nearby.
Looting businesses, setting fires and assaulting police offices with rocks and bricks and glass.
You saw that.
Joe Biden has the support of violent left wing extremists.
He never once mentioned the words law and order during their entire Democrat National Convention.
Never once.
They didn't talk about the riots, they didn't talk about anything having to do with law and order and respect and our great police.
They didn't do it.
They didn't talk about it.
It's not a subject.
They will rip your cities apart and they will go to your suburbs for all of those people in the suburbs that are ready to go about, they will go to your suburbs next.
I have the support of America's law enforcement heroes.
I was recently honored to be endorsed by the largest group of police and police representatives in the country.
We're endorsed by everybody.
We're joined by Butler County Mike Slupe.
Thank you, Mike, as well as two sheriffs who just changed their registrations, oh that's nice, to become Republicans.
They were long time Democrats.
Who are those two showers?
Wow.
Thank you.
It's Fayette County Sheriff James Custer and Forest County Sheriff, Bob Wolfgang.
Where's Bob?
Stand up, fellows.
Thank you.
Were you long time Democrats?
How the hell did that happen?
Well, this is somewhat of a phenomena.
This is somewhat … This is crazy what's going on now.
It can be stopped so easily, and you guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
Thank you very much.
It's an honor to have you in the party.
Thank you.
That's great.
There's a whole great group of sheriffs and law enforcement here.
Also, with us, our Congressman Guy Russian Reschenthaler.
Guy.
Where's Guy?
Great warrior.
Where are they sitting?
And a friend of mine and a warrior.
He's a warrior.
He's tough as hell.
They said, "We want to impeach the president for making a perfect phone call."
Oh, did you hear today?
They want to impeach me again.
They said, if I submit the name of one of the most talented people in the world to be a justice of the Supreme Court, they want to impeach me.
They want to impeach me if I'm following the constitution.
No, think of it.
This is crazy Nancy.
These people are stonecold crazy.
Think of it.
I got impeached for making a perfect phone call.
Perfect phone call.
Everybody read it.
Nobody to this day … and the Republicans stuck together.
It was great.
Also, a friend of mine and he wanted to just rip them apart, I remember when he heard about it.
He's a rough guy and he's a popular guy too.
They love him.
Congressman Mike Kelly.
Thank you, Mike.
Come on up here.
Come on up here.
Just come up.
Come on up.
Mike, come up.
Come on.
Guy, come up.
Congressmen Glenn Thompson, Congressman Dan Muser, come on.
And Congressman Scott Perry.
Thank you, Mike.
Hey Mike, good shape.
Come on, get up there.
Oh what a group.
What a group.
Thank you.
He's the real deal.
Conor lamb is just a puppet for Nancy Pelosi and crying Chuck Schumer.
You know crying Chuck?
He cries every time he thinks it's appropriate.
Now, I'll tell you what.
This Conor lamb turned out to be a stonecold phony.
When he was running … It's a very Trump … they like me.
I thought he was a Republican because his ads were so good.
"We have to respect our president.
We have … " I said, "This guy's doing some beautiful ads," and then I found out he was a Democrat.
I'll tell you what.
He's nothing compared to Sean.
Sean is the real deal.
Thank you so much.
Just give a little hand, because he's done a hell of a job too.
Our campaign chair, Bernie Comfort.
Thank you, Bernie.
Bernie Comfort.
Thank you.
Thank you to Bernie Comfort.
Thanks, Bern.
All right.
While you guys are standing behind me like a beautiful curtain there … Well they're not blocking Air Force One so we could … But I have a woman with us tonight who has devoted so much.
She gave up her business.
She said, "Dad, I'm going to come to Washington and help you.
I love you daddy, and we're going to help people.
I don't care and … " She was very successful in every way, and it's my daughter Ivanka.
I just want to thank this group of people.
And a man that helped, we just negotiated a major peace deal in the Middle East.
Everyone said it was impossible.
You know that, right?
They said it's impossible.
They've been killing everybody for years and years, they had this guy, John Kerry, who's grossly incompetent.
They paid $150 billion to Iran, they paid 1.8 billion in cash.
That's even more impressive, frankly, in cash, that's John Kerry.
And we just made a deal with Bahrain and UAE, United Arab Emirates, and Israel, and it's a great thing.
And the man right there, Jared, the abuse, the abuse he takes, but he did something that nobody's been able to do, and he wants none of the glory, he'd rather not come up here.
These guys will come up 100%.
Jared, great deal, great job.
Incredible.
Everyone's talking about it.
We have plenty of other countries going to join and there's no blood in the sand.
Okay.
Thanks honey.
Thank you.
Great people.
Thank you, Sean.
Thank you, Sean.
We have spent the last four years reversing the damage that Joe Biden inflicted over the last 40.
They like Sean.
Sean, will you please win?
Sean Parnell.
I'll tell you, he's popular.
That's great, Sean.
We love Sean.
But Biden championed every globalist portrayal of Pennsylvania for half a century, he was a cheerleader for the worst trade deal ever made by any country, NAFTA and China's entry into the world trade organization, which built China like a rocket ship.
They were flat lined for many, many decades and then right through the roof, that was a Biden approval.
These disasters ripped out one third of your state's manufacturing jobs.
You know what happened.
Biden shouldn't be asking for your vote, he should be begging for your forgiveness.
He did a terrible job.
Now the Democrat party is pledging to rejoin the disastrous Paris Climate Accord.
You want to spend a lot of money for nothing?
Eviscerating your state's economy, you will spend a trillion dollars and what it is really, it takes away your power, it takes away your energy.
You'll be closing your plants and factories all over the place.
I withdrew from it.
And you know what, the people that understand, the smart people, they said, "I can't believe you had the guts to do it."
And I figured I was going to be absolutely killed on this one.
And you know what, I'm so proud I did it and people get it.
It was a rip off of the United States.
I withdrew from the catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pittsburgh, not for Paris.
This election is a choice between Pennsylvania and China, if Biden wins, China wins.
When we win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins.
For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars that never ended and defending foreign borders.
But now we're finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, back home in the USA where they belong.
All coming home.
During the pandemic, I've suspended the entry of foreign workers who threatened American jobs.
As our economy reopens, I want to ensure that Americans are first in line to get the great jobs and the high wages.
Hello, Houston.
I am so thrilled to be here in the great state of Texas with one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends, Prime Minister Modi of India.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And Prime Minister Modi is doing a truly exceptional job for India and for all of the Indian people.
It is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event.
We're especially grateful to be joined by over 50,000 incredible members of our nation's thriving, prospering, flourishing, and hardworking Indian American community.
Thank you.
Just a few months ago in the largest democratic election in the history of our world, 600 million Indians went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Modi and his party.
Congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister.
That's a lot of people.
Earlier this week, I understand you marked another important milestone.
I know everyone here joins me in wishing you a very happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
I want to take a moment to address every resident of Houston effected by the recent horrible flooding.
The entire American nation is standing by your side.
We're ready.
We love you.
We support you.
We will be there with you every single step of the way.
I just left the Coast Guard hanger at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base where I was briefed on the Texas flooding.
We're working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.
Thank you very much.
We're working hard together.
My administration will not rest until you have fully recovered, restored, and rebuilt and I know you will come back with the same tremendous spirit that we have shown every single time, every time there's been a problem.
It's called "Houston strong."
Prime Minister Modi and I have come to Houston to celebrate everything that unites America and India, our shared dreams and bright futures.
I've also come to express my profound gratitude to the nearly 4 million amazing Indian Americans all across our country.
You enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American and we are proud to have you as Americans.
We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day.
I want to recognize US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and Minister Jaishankar of India.
Thank you very much.
Thank you both.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We're also proudly joined by NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard, Deputy Secretary Of Energy Dan Brouillette, Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, your state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a couple of very great senators.
Kevin, thank you.
Thank you all for being here.
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you.
We have a lot of senators.
We have a lot of Congress people.
There's Mr. Brady, Congressman Brady.
He gave us a very, very nice tax cut folks.
Thank you, Kevin, very much.
Thank you all for being here.
Among the leaders here today for this remarkable celebration are many members of the House and Senate.
They're all over the audience, including House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and again, senators Cornyn, Cruz.
In my campaign for president, I promised all of that.
If we were elected, India would have a true and great friend in the White House and I can tell you, you have never had a better friend as president that President Donald Trump.
That I can tell you.
The prime minister knows that.
On this day, I'm happy to report that the relationship between the United States and India is stronger than ever before.
The ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy.
We are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence.
We are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty.
Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, "We the People."
That means that in America AMD India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve.
Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving Republic of India.
In a single decade, with the help of Prime Minister Modi's pro-growth reforms, India has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number.
Incredible.
That's incredible.
In the next decade, 140 million Indian households will rise to the middle class.
In both India and the United States, we're seeing something really remarkable.
Our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape.
In the United States, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another.
Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs.
We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs.
They said that couldn't be done.
Unemployment … Think of this.
Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number.
Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country.
Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent.
Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years.
In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we've done.
And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women.
First time that's ever happened.
Through our pledge to America's workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies.
We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country.
We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than $3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent.
Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future.
Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives.
They're developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they're founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens.
Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before.
And that's what's happening.
The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning.
Here in the United States, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams.
Indian companies employ tens of thousands of Americans across a range of industries, including American steel.
In 2018 India's JSW Steel announced that it would invest up to $500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of Ohio.
And we welcome India's growing investments right here in the Lone Star State.
Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world.
They have never invested in our country like they are today.
And we want to thank everybody and India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today.
And I want to say it's reciprocal because we're doing the same thing in India.
On Tuesday, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Aisin, announced a combined investment of almost $800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in Texas.
At the same time, we are working to expand American exports to India, one of the world's fastest growing markets.
We are committed to ensuring the Indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, "Made in the USA."
And very soon, India will have access to another world class American product, NBA basketball.
Wow, sounds good.
That sounds good.
Next week thousands of people will gather in Mumbai to watch the first ever NBA basketball game in India.
Am I invited, Mr. Prime Minister?
I may come.
Be careful.
I may come.
When it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security.
For the first time ever, the United States is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of Texas.
That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump.
Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years.
And we have plenty of it.
Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers.
Thank you.
These tremendous exports not only expand employment in America, but they increase freedom and security for India.
To keep our nation safe, the United States and India forging an even stronger security partnership.
US defense sales to India have also reached $18 billion over the past decade.
We make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and India knows that well.
We're looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon.
There are a lot of them in the works.
Here in America, we're creating the United States Space Force and we're working closely with India to enhance space cooperation.
In November, the United States and India will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations.
It's called Tiger Triumph.
Good name, it's a good name.
Very good name.
Today, we honor all of the brave American and Indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom.
We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.
Thank you.
Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders.
Since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry.
We are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like- … country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close.
We're doing it on a daily basis, and we'll soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security.
Border security is vital to the United States.
Border security is vital to India.
We understand that.
We are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration.
I want to thank the president of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.
It's been incredible what's taken place in a short period of time.
Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws.
Yet there are those in Washington who would raid your healthcare to … Free benefits.
They want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally.
We don't want to do that.
We don't want to do that.
Because if we don't do it, they won't come.
I will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants.
My administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all.
We must always be for the American people, whether it's African-American, Hispanic-American, Indian-American.
We are going to take care of our citizens first.
We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country.
Well, thank you very much.
Vice President Mike Pence, great job you're doing.
And hello Toledo!
We love Toledo.
You remember, I was here a lot.
You remember 2016, what a year that was, right?
And 2020 is going to be even better, no doubt.
But I'm thrilled to hold the first rally of 2020 right here in the great state of Ohio.
And as we begin the new year, our economy is booming, wages are soaring, workers are thriving, and America's future has never, ever looked brighter, ever.
We're the envy of every country in the world.
We've created seven million brand new jobs since our election.
And we will soon be replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the incredible brand new USMCA, the historic victory for Ohio farmers, workers, and manufacturers, but really a great victory for the United States.
It's an incredible agreement.
You remember I came and I'd always talk about how bad our trade deals are.
We did a brand new one with Korea.
So now we have South Korea, we just finished a big one, $40 billion with Japan.
On January 15, we're signing a monster, a big beautiful monster, $40 to $50 billion to our farmers.
Our farmers will be taking in, I keep saying go buy larger tractors.
Go buy larger tractors.
I said there's no way, I don't know if you know this story, my people wanted 20 billion to purchase, right?
20 billion, 20, that's a lot money, that's a lot of corn, $20 billion, and I said, "Make it 50.
China's very big."
And they said, "Okay."
They said, "Sir, the farmers can't produce that much."
I said, "Let the farmers tell me that.
Tell them to go out and, remember, and buy a bigger what?
Tractor, buy a bigger tractor."
You'll produce it.
So $40 to $50 billion of agriculture product and the manufacturers and the car companies, and we brought a lot of car companies into Ohio, you know that.
A lot of them are coming in.
A lot of them have already been brought in.
They're coming in from Japan, they're coming in from all over the world.
This is where they want to be.
They want to be in the United States.
This is where the action is.
They're all coming back.
I used to go around and talk about how everyone's leaving.
They were all leaving.
A lot of you were victims of that leaving.
These companies would leave, they'd go to Mexico, they'd go to Canada, they'd close up, they'd buy from China.
Now they're all coming back, new ones, old ones, they're all coming back, and many are coming right here to Ohio.
And just in case you didn't know it, Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state.
That's not bad, that's not bad.
And this year's going to be even better and maybe much better.
But weeks ago, I signed the largest ever investment in the United States military, $ 738 billion, and we created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force, and everybody's excited about that.
After years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military.
Some of it's still coming in.
We have everything.
We've got new planes, we've got new rockets, new missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2.5 trillion in new investments.
So our military is now stronger and more powerful than ever before.
And if you remember, three years ago when I took over, we were depleted.
Our military was totally depleted.
And by the way, speaking of our military, have we taken care of our vets with Choice, with Choice.
That was a big thing.
You know, I used to go around and the VA was a terrible situation.
People would wait weeks.
He's right, he said, "Yes, it was."
You don't hear too much about that anymore, have you noticed?
Choice and accountability, you know what accountability is?
For 44 years, they tried to get accountability.
That's somebody bad, works for the VA, you couldn't fire them.
You couldn't fire them.
They could be sadistic, they could be thieves, they could be whatever they were, you couldn't get rid of them.
We got accountability approved, and now we say, "You're fired, get out."
We get somebody that's good.
44 years, and maybe most importantly of all is Choice, VA, Veterans Choice.
So you now wait in line, and a lot of times you'd wait in line for four or five, six weeks you couldn't see a doctor.
Now you don't have to wait.
You go out to a private doctor, you get yourself taken care of, we pay the bill.
What a difference it's made.
What a difference it's made.
You know, when I was a little bit newer to this game– That's okay, they got it, they got it.
They go home to mommy.
Go on home to mommy.
Go on home to mommy.
It's a beautiful sight.
Thank you, security.
Do we love law enforcement, by the way?
So with the VA, I used to go around saying, "Why don't they do that?
Why don't these people, why don't they go to a private doctor and work something out?"
And I thought it was a brilliant plan.
I said, "I'm telling you I am such a smart guy."
I said, "This is the most brilliant thing ever."
And I went back to my people and I said, "I have an idea.
A veteran's sick, they can't get the kind of service they need, they need a certain kind of doctor, I have an idea, such a great idea.
You get to go out, private, you're going to pick out a doctor, you're going to get yourself fixed up.
We're going to pay the bill, right?"
And you know what happened?
And I said, "How brilliant is that?"
They said, "Sir, we've been working on that for 48 years, but we've never been able to get it approved."
So I was very, very disillusioned, but you know what I'm good at?
Getting things approved.
And we got it approved.
So we signed that 11 months ago, and what a difference that's made in terms of your lines and in terms of people's health.
People would wait online for weeks, and some people weren't very sick and they'd end up being terminally ill.
They couldn't get to see the doctor.
Now they go out, they get a doctor, we take care of them.
We can take care of our vets.
So we're using this great power not to pursue conflict, but to really preserve, and I mean in the true sense of the word, preserve peace.
We have this tremendous military, and you know what that is?
That's really a great fighting force, but I hope we never have to use it.
I really do.
You saw an example of that a couple of days ago.
So we seek friends, not enemies, but if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril.
We've never had a military, what we have now, we've never had anything like it.
We were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50, 60-year-old planes.
You've heard the story, the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them.
Those are all gone now, folks.
Those are all gone.
In October of last year, US Special Operations Forces executed a daring nighttime raid that killed the bloodthirsty founder and leader of ISIS.
The animal known as al- Baghdadi is dead.
And the entire ISIS caliphate is destroyed, and his terrorist empire, and he was indeed a monster, has been totally demolished.
We killed thousands and thousands of ISIS warriors, fighters, and we have thousands of them right now locked up where they should be.
Nobody has ever done what we've done in three years.
And I'll say this, when we took it over, it was a mess.
We did it in a short period of time, but when we took it over, it was not good.
And last week, the United States once again took the bold and decisive action to save American lives and deliver American justice.
And you know what I'm talking about.
For years, the sadistic mass murderer, Qasam Soleimani, planned and executed attacks against American targets, killing and wounding thousands of US service members and many, many thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of other people.
As the leader of Iran's terrorist Quds Force, Soleimani spread death, destruction, and mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond.
He ordered the violent assault on the American embassy in Baghdad.
And you saw this was the anti-Benghazi.
We got there very quickly.
We got there very quickly.
This is the exact opposite, we did it exactly the opposite of Benghazi, where they got there so late, all they saw when they got there days later were burning embers from the days before.
That's all they saw.
We got there very early.
We saw what was happening.
I saw what was happening, and I said, "What's that all about?"
And that was going to be another Benghazi.
Had they broken through the final panels of glass, they were breaking and breaking it, had they gotten through, we would have had either hundreds of dead people or hundreds of hostages.
That wasn't going to happen.
And I called up our great generals, and I said, "Get them over there now."
And one of our leaders, one of our really admired people, said, "Sir, we'll have them there tomorrow."
I said, "Nope, get in the planes right now, have them there immediately," and they got there immediately, fortunately.
But he directed the recent rocket strikes that wounded four American service members, badly wounded, and killed an American citizen.
That was just before we happened to hit him.
Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies, and not just the embassy in Baghdad.
But we stopped him, we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.
So at my direction, the United States military eliminated Qasam Soleimani and ended his rampage through not only that part of the world, but much bigger parts of the world, he was all over.
He was a bad guy, he was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror, he's dead.
And yet now I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist.
And you know, instead they should be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless victims were denied justice for so long.
He was the king of the roadside bomb.
You know of the roadside bomb, and then they got bigger, and he'd send them over to Afghanistan and Iraq.
And when you see our friends and our great wounded warriors and our great warriors, when you see them without their legs and without arms and with so much damage, it's most likely that he caused that damage, because that's what he liked.
He loved planting the roadside bomb.
So now he's gone, and that's a good thing.
Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie, has condemned the US military strike on Soleimani, the world's top terrorist, think of it, the world's top terrorist, and we're having people like Nancy Pelosi, that's a real genius, do you believe that one?
Nancy, nervous Nancy.
But here's a guy who slaughtered and butchered civilians all over and military, whoever was in his way, and we have Bernie and Nancy Pelosi, we have them all, they're all trying to say, "How dare you take him out that way?
You should get permission from Congress.
You should come in and tell us what you want to do.
You should come in and tell us so that we can call up the fake news that's back there and we can leak it."
That's a lot of corruption back there, folks.
No, but think, seriously, so they want me… So these are split-second decisions.
You have to make a decision.
So they don't want me to make that decision.
They want me to call up, maybe go over there, let me go over to Congress, or come on over to the White House, let's talk about it.
When can you make it?
Well, I won't be able to make it today, sir, so how about say in a couple of days?
Oh, good, come on over.
No, we got a call, we heard where he was, we knew the way he was getting there, and we had to make a decision.
We didn't have time to call up Nancy, who is not operating with a full deck.
No, they want us to call, can you imagine calling crooked Adam Schiff?
He's so crooked, he's so crooked.
Shifty Schiff and say, "Gee, Adam, how are you doing?
Listen, we have the world's number one terrorist, killed thousands and thousands of people.
We'd like to set up a meeting so we can discuss his execution.
Would you be willing to meet?"
"Well, I won't be able to make it this week."
"Well, you know, he's traveling fast.
We got him lined up, Adam, you little pencil-neck."
Nine inches.
He buys the smallest shirt collar you can get, and it's loose.
Now come on, Adam, we got to meet faster on it.
We got to take this guy out.
We're not going to have another shot at him maybe ever again.
"But I can't make it now because I'm trying to impeach Trump, I'm trying to impeach, even though he did nothing wrong."
By the way, did you see, I did nothing wrong.
They don't even know what in the hell is going on.
In fact, it's so weak, she doesn't want to put in the articles, it's so weak.
They're so pathetic.
They're so pathetic.
So they want us to call them.
Now, Schiff is a big leaker.
He leaks to crazy CNN.
See with the little red light on over there.
Not too many people are watching CNN.
But he leaks.
So he'll say, "You know, off the record, I got to hurry up because everyone's watching me in the hallway on my cell phone, off the record they've got the number one terrorist in the world, Soleimani, and they're going to get him, they're going to take him out in the next 10 minutes.
Please, don't tell anybody I told you."
So we have breaking news, President Trump within the next 20, 25 minutes, looks to be taking out terrorist General Soleimani.
He's going to do it.
It should be happening in about the next 20 minutes, 19, 18, 17."
Then we get back to the battlefield, how'd you do, fellas?
"I don't know, sir, he disappeared.
I don't know what happened to him."
They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their friends in the corrupt media.
You got to say though, that's a lot of media, right?
That's the way the Academy Awards used to look when it was successful.
Then they started hitting us all the time and it became unsuccessful.
I love it, I love it, actually.
Oh, they have some bad ones here tonight.
They have some really bad ones, some really sick ones.
They have one good one, by the way, one good one.
They have one good one, a bunch of bad ones.
Very, very dishonest people and we have some great ones, too.
We have some great journalists, great reporters.
But you've got a tremendous amount of dishonest media people like I have never seen in my life before.
They write things that they know are wrong.
They write, if you watched for the last three years, think of it, and then they get Pulitzer Prizes, but it turned out to be all wrong.
How do you do that?
They get Pulitzer Prizes for being wrong.
The Pulitzer Prize doesn't mean a thing.
It doesn't mean a thing.
I mean, I'm here to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize.
I'll tell you about that.
I made a deal.
I saved a country.
And I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Noble Peace Prize for saving the country.
I said, "Did I have something to do with it?"
Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is.
As long as we know, that's all that matters.
I saved a big war.
I saved a couple of them.
But under my administration, we will never make excuses for America's enemies, we will never hesitate in defending American lives, and we will never stop working to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, never.
And nobody's done it like we've done it.
And it's we, it's we.
It's not me, it's we.
It's a whole movement.
There has, by the way, never been a movement like this.
You know, outside, I don't know what this place holds, it's like 10, 11,000 people, right?
Outside you have thousands and thousands of people that want to get in.
There's never been a movement like this.
There's never been a movement like this.
And I'll tell you, maybe I'm wrong, but this is bigger than it was in 2016, because in 2016 I said what we're going to do, but now I've completed more promises than I've made.
I mean, I've actually completed more, right?
Like, as an example, many of you were here, look at all those beautiful red hats, keep America great, that's good.
But I never talked about, did you ever hear me prior to the election talk about Space Force?
I never talked about it.
We did Space Force, but did we ever speak about it?
No.
There were many things that we've done that we never spoke about, right?
Right to Try, you know about Right to Try, right?
They've been trying to get it for 44 years, Right to Try.
That's people that are very sick, terminally ill, and they can't get medicine that possibly works.
And very well, we have the greatest labs and the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest scientists in the world, we have the greatest medicines in the world.
If they have something that they're pretty sure is going to work but is going to take another six years, I brought those times way back, by the way, way down, but they would travel to Asia, they would travel to Europe, they would travel all over the world to try and get a cure because we wouldn't sell them the medicine because we didn't want to take a chance on making the people sick.
I said, "Wait a minute, they're going to die.
They're going to die."
"Well, sir, we can't take the liability."
I said, "Then we'll draw up a statement assessing all liability, taking all liability away from the country, away from the insurance companies, away from the healthcare companies, away from the doctors."
And with the great help of a lot of incredible Republicans, and we had some Democrats help us, we passed Right to Try, and you have to see how this works.
Some people are being, many people are being saved.
And you know, the drug companies didn't like it because they didn't want to take people that sick, because they didn't want it on their charts.
I said, "I understand that.
We won't include that.
We'll have a separate list over here."
They said, "Oh, would you do that?"
I said, "Yeah, I'll do that, I'll do that."
But I didn't talk about Right to Try.
I never said I was going to get that done, we got it done.
That was a tough one to get done.
It sounds simple, but it was tough.
There's nothing easy in this country.
You know, they said to me, a friend of mine the other day, "Who's the toughest country to deal with, President?"
He used to call me Donald.
I've known this guy for a long time.
I'd like to say 20 years, but it's much more than that.
I just don't want to tell you how long, it's too long.
And I said, "Call me Donald.
You've always called me Donald."
"I can't."
He calls me Mr. President.
I've known this guy forever.
He used to call me, "Hey, Donald, let's go out to dinner."
You know before, he'd go, "Hey, let's go out to dinner."
Now he goes, "Mr. President, sir, how are you?"
Right?
How are you?
But what we've done, and he said, he told me, "What you've done, we've never seen anything like it."
So many people are saying that.
We are all together doing something, not only in terms of the election, not only in terms of what we're doing right now.
Don't forget, it's a long way to the election.
You know, we have what, 10 months?
That's a long way.
This is my first stop of the year, first major stop of the year.
This is it.
And we start.
By the way, let's do one of those polls right now, do you mind?
Is there anything more fun than a Trump rally?
Here we are.
Anything more fun than a Trump rally?
Here we are.
We have the greatest phrase of all time, Make America Great Again, and all due respect, I'll never end … I'm a little superstitious.
I'll never end it, Make America Great Again, but I see all those hats.
I see all those hats, changing it a little bit, but Make America Great Again.
I said, you know, today, we just hit the highest stock price in the history of our country.
Your 401ks are at records, your stocks are great, but what it really means to me is jobs, more importantly, than anything else.
We have the best jobs, the best everything, right?
We just hit … I can't really say, Make America Great Again.
Our military is rebuilt, $2.5 trillion.
Our military is rebuilt.
We're doing great numbers.
Economically, our country is the strongest it's ever been.
You have factories moving back into Ohio.
You never saw anything like it, right?
You had your best year.
When I say Make America Great Again, what that sort of means is we didn't get there, but we did get there.
Now, I have a new theme.
It's called Keep America Great.
Keep America Great.
Now, I'm a very loyal person, and I am concerned about changing the theme because Make America Great Again I think was the greatest political campaign in history.
I mean, crooked Hillary spent three or four times more money than I have spent.
Crooked Hillary, wait, crooked … We should lock her up, I'll tell you.
Crooked Hillary spent three or four times more.
I wanted to be a little bit … I have to say, that was a great campaign, and I don't want to change it.
I don't want to have this incredible 2016, then go with something, and if something ever happened, this country will go to hell, I just … You know the stocks I'm talking about, the records.
You don't have records this way.
You have records.
Get used to it, because if that happened, you will see things happen that aren't good.
But, I have to now say, do I want to change the greatest theme in political history, Make America Great Again, with Keep America Great, right?
Let's take a little applause, right?
We'll go Make America Great Again, you'd clap if you want that.
Then we would go, Keep America Great, you'd clap if you like that.
Okay, are you ready?
First, Make America Great Again.
Ready?
Keep America Great.
You know, that, I call that a free poll.
That's better than a poll.
Do you ever see these crazy polls that come out?
We're doing great in the polls, by the way.
Remember, I used to come out and talk about the polls?
We'll start doing that very soon.
We're doing great in the polls, but this is like a free poll.
Somebody else would go out, they have all this money that they raised, and they give somebody $1 million, and they'll ask 200 people that question.
Then, they'll say, "Well, Make America Great Again is better," but I will tell you, I haven't heard one thing where that was true.
With all of these … I would have said, instinctively, Make America Great Again could not be beaten.
I've probably done this 10 times.
I have never had it win.
It's Keep America Great, and that's what we're doing, but we're going to use both.
We're going to use both … Good.
Keep America Great.
We're going to use both, but Keep America Great.
That's probably going to be the dominant theme.
For eight years, the Obama administration enabled and emboldened- … the Iranian regime.
They gave Iran $150 billion, including $1.7 billion- … in hard, cold cash.
Can you imagine?
No, no, can you imagine?
$1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in cash?
The foolish Iran nuclear deal financed Iranian aggression while allowing a quick path to nuclear breakout, that's what it did.
By the way, it expires so soon.
They can have nuclear weapons.
They're not, as I said before, they will not have nuclear weapons.
… They hit us with 16 missiles, and I said, "How many?"
We were ready to go.
We were ready to go.
I said, "How many?
How many died?
How many were wounded?"
"Sir, none."
None?
Pretty good warning system, none.
How many were hurt?
How many were … None, sir.
So, we didn't do anything.
We were ready.
We were ready.
Not that I wanted to, but we were ready.
You have no idea.
A lot of people got very lucky.
… We have a lot of your Congressmen right now in Congress.
They said, "Sir, should we come with you?"
I said, "No, stay back and vote."
They're voting on some pretty important stuff, right?
But, we were able to get Bill.
We thank you, Bill, very much, great job, great warrior.
Thank you, Bill.
Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted.
Thank you, Jon.
Thank you, Jon.
Thank you, Jon.
Great job.
State Treasurer, Robert Sprague.
Thank you, Robert, and you have a lot more money in the bank right now, Robert, as Treasurer, right, than you ever did?
Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Judy French.
Thank you, Judy.
Great job.
State Senate President, a man highly respected, Larry Obhof.
Thank you, Larry.
And, a woman who really has become a great friend of mine.
She took over this party.
We fought like hell.
We had some other people that had their mind on taking over the party, but they'd never had a chance against Jane Timken, Jane.
And, the man who is in charge of my campaign in Ohio, I had a choice of five people.
I said, "I like this guy's name."
I don't know why.
His name is Bob Paduchik.
Why do I like his name?
I said "Bob, how are we doing?"
He said, "You're going to win big, sir."
Because, you know, you keep hearing, you cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.
That's these guys.
Once, I was leading Ohio by a lot in the poll.
They never say that anymore.
It's terrible.
They were saying it when they thought I wasn't going to win, but we were ahead right from the beginning.
… I said, "Bob, let me ask you, just out of curiosity, I don't have these people.
The leaders are not with us.
Is that good or bad?"
He said, "Sir, it's great.
You just went up three points, would you believe this, by not having it?"
He said, "Don't worry, sir, you're going to win," and we won by a lot.
Now, I understand we're up by a lot more than we ever thought possible.
Bob was fantastic.
Thank you, Bob.
… Then, one of these characters back there, they put me in a contest with the late great Abraham Lincoln, right?
Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln?
I said Abraham Lincoln- I said, who do you like better?
They say they did a poll on this.
I think I remember the numbers.
All I know is, we won against Abraham, Honest Abe.
We won, 53 to 47.
Can you believe that, Abraham Lincoln?
I went back to the First Lady, I said, "First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll."
I don't know if they had polls back then, but Abraham Lincoln.
I always say I can be more Presidential than any candidate that ever ran, than any President, other than maybe Abraham Lincoln when he's wearing his hat.
I like Abe Lincoln, but when we're doing well, we have a lot of support.
Do you know why?
Because our country is doing so well.
Our country is doing so well.
When we went out, we started, and we went right to the top of the polls.
It wasn't like these folks today.
They are 2%, 3%, but they're climbing.
We went right to the top from day one.
We never missed center stage in the debates.
Remember those great debates?
We actually got high ratings.
They don't get very good ratings anymore.
They're like, it's like death, watching.
I should watch.
You know, I'm supposed to watch.
It's like my job.
Try and watch, watch the competition, but it's like watching death.
… Did you see where Pocahontas is slipping, badly?
Bernie, Bernie has gone up.
He's surging, Bernie's, crazy Bernie, he's surging, and Biden doesn't know the difference between Iran and Iraq.
He's gotten it wrong four times.
He goes, "When we took our shot at Iraq …" No, no, no.
They're all saying, "No, no," they're screaming, "It's Iran, Iran."
What?
His son, right?
Where's Hunter, where is Hunter?
No, I went to one of them.
I said, "We have to have where is Hunter as a witness."
They said, "What do you mean, where is Hunter?"
I said, "That's his first name.
I have now made his first name Where's.
Where's Hunter?"
Here's a guy, made no money, got thrown out of the military forces, I think the Navy, got thrown out, had no job, had no nothing, so, he went from that to making millions of dollars a year as soon as Sleepy Joe became Vice President.
He made millions of dollars a year.
Would anybody in this room do that for millions of … I would.
He made millions and millions of dollars a year.
Ukraine took care of him.
How about China?
He walked out with $1.5 billion to manage, and he never did it before.
He didn't know anything about oil and gas.
He was making a fortune.
So, where is Hunter?
Where the hell are you, Hunter?
I'll tell you, I sort of hope it's Joe, because he will hear where's Hunter every single debate, nine times a debate.
Where is Hunter?
… Howdy Doody.
The problem is, a lot of people don't remember Alfred E. Neuman.
Don't say that.
You look much younger than that, I must say.
You have Mayor Pete.
I mean, give me a break.
Can you believe Mayor Pete?
This is going to be the President of the United States?
How would he be against negotiating against President Xi of China?
We just made one hell of a deal.
You're going to see the numbers very soon, you know?
One hell of a deal.
They didn't like those tariffs.
Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning again, and America, most importantly, is respected again, respected like never before.
You know, for years, NATO has taken advantage of the United States.
We protect Europe from Russia, and the numbers have been going down for many, many years, 15 years, 18 years.
The numbers is like a roller coaster down.
I went over, and I said "Folks, you got to pay your bills.
You're delinquent.
You're delinquent."
Then, they don't like me.
They say, "We like Obama better."
They should like Obama better.
Obama would go in and say, "Thank you very much for coming.
We appreciate it.
Bye-bye, I'm going back to Washington.
I'm going back.
I'll be violating the carbon footprint.
I'm going to Hawaii to play golf."
I drive to play a round of golf at the course I own, it doesn't even cost them anything.
He flies to Hawaii, nobody cares.
If I drive 20 minutes, it's like, "Donald Trump is playing golf today.
He violates the carbon footprint," but just think of it.
Think of where we've come.
Think of where we've come.
A great congressman from Tennessee, they have … It's a great state.
They have early voting, very early voting, probably the earliest.
He said, "I don't know.
I just left Tennessee."
This was in November.
This was the election, 2016.
He said, "I just left this incredible state of mine, and I love that state.
Sir, we've seen lines of people that didn't vote before, because they never were inspired to vote," and these are people that never voted.
They had hats on, Trump.
They have pins, on Trump, Trump, Trump, and Trump.
They have the bands on, you know, like a Miss Universe, prom.
It says, Trump Pence, and they've got buttons all over it.
They've got shirts saying Trump and Trump Pence.
I never saw anything like it.
"If every state is like Tennessee, sir, I hate to tell you, you're going to have one hell of a victory," and that's what happened, right?
That's happened.
You did it.
You did it, and I think we're going to have bigger numbers, even bigger numbers, because I'll tell you what, we're a long way from the election.
I think the crowds today are bigger than they were the day before the election last time.
I really do.
You know, Elizabeth Warren- … sadly referred to, she of great Indian heritage.
Remember, I used to say, "I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none."
I turned out to be right.
You look at what she's doing, you look at what she's saying, the lies, the deceit, the fraud, you see it all.
We are going to do so great.
It's got to be something that's going to be special.
It's going to be for the record books.
The Evangelicals called some of the greatest pastors, ministers, preachers, and they just called today, five of the most respected people.
They said things that were incredible.
They said, "There's never been anything like this in the church that they can …" Some of them have been doing it for 30, 40 years.
They said, "We have never seen enthusiasm like we see for this President and for this Presidency, all of us, like we have right now."
… He never said that before.
Billy Graham wasn't somebody that would vote and say he voted.
Franklin Graham said Billy Graham, maybe the greatest of all, maybe the greatest of all time, he said "My father, Billy Graham," who was very old at the time and in trouble, he was in trouble, he was not well, "he voted for Donald Trump."
What a great tribute that was to me.
What a great tribute.
Great family.
Unemployment has reached the lowest level in over 51 years.
African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American unemployment have all reached the lowest rates ever, ever, ever recorded.
Wages are rising fast.
They're going up very fast, and the biggest percentage increase, makes me happy, are for blue-collar workers.
40 million.
Think of this, 40 million American families are now benefiting from the Republican child tax credit, each receiving an average of over $2,200 a year.
Now, America lost … This is hard to believe, because you think, "How could it possibly be true?"
but this is what happened.
Probably, it's the number one reason I'm running.
America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000.
You wouldn't believe that it's possible, but I know it's true, because I've said it 50 times, and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me.
No, it's true.
No, it's true.
If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, there'd be a headline, Donald Trump Told a Fib.
Donald Trump gets to be a Pinocchio again.
No.
Think of it, 60,000 factories, plants and factories, closed, closed.
They went to Mexico.
They went to China.
60,000.
It's not even … Take a look at a map and put 60,000 little dots.
I mean, you wouldn't believe it could be that many, but it is, it's 60,000 closed, gone.
They're all coming back.
They're all coming back.
Right now, just in a very short period of time, we've added 12,000 brand new factories, and many more are coming in.
One of the reasons they're coming in is we've eliminated a record number of job- killing regulations, saving the average American household $3,000 a year.
Total income gains for median households will reach over, ready?
$10,000 a family.
$10,000.
Now, under the Bush administration, the $10,000, that includes what we've done in terms of median income.
I'm adding in there the tax cuts, which are tremendous, $2,400.
I'm adding the regulation cuts, I'm adding the whole package over $10,000.
Now, under President Bush, it was $450.
Under Barack Hussein Obama, it was $975.
Under President Donald J. Trump, it's $10,000 in three years, three.
In three years.
Don't forget, President Bush, eight years, $450.
President Obama, eight years, $975.
President Trump, three years, not even, not even, not even, but three years, $10,000.
We're going up.
We're going up.
… Clean coal.
What they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal.
With the help of energy workers right here in Ohio, the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, number one.
We were number one.
… You know, there's a state known as Texas, and I won Texas by a lot, just like I won Ohio by a lot.
How would you like to go into Texas and say, "By the way, we don't want your oil or natural gas anymore?"
How about that Beto?
Remember he said, "I was born to be President."
Anybody that says that, I said, "That's the end of his career."
Remember, he had the cover of the magazine?
I won't mention the magazine, sleazebag magazine.
He was born to be President, and right after that, he came tumbling down, but he's from Texas, so he was against religion, he was against oil, and he was against guns.
Abraham Lincoln could not win in Texas with that platform.
That's not a good platform.
It's not a good platform, but you have people that want to shut down the oil industry.
If you do that, you're going to shut down half your businesses.
It's really more than that, and the rest of them are not going to be able to pay because the cost of this energy would be so expensive.
We have all forms of energy.
We have every form of energy, and we are doing great, but they want to cripple your state's economy.
The voters of Ohio will never let that happen, never going to let it happen.
Our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years.
Sadly, I can't say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago, there was nobody here, right?
I assume that 2, 300 years ago was cleaner, probably.
You never know, but our water and our air is as clean as it's ever been, and I took us out of that horrible Paris accord.
I always say, "How are you doing with the Paris accord?"
Don't ask.
Saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us, in my opinion.
It was put in there to hurt us.
We were paying money to India.
We were paying money to China.
China's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately.
We had to pay money.
Russia kicked in, in 20 … Let's see, they kicked in before.
They were 1990, wait, they were 1996.
That was a very dirty period of air, so, they didn't have … We kick in now, and that, it's just unacceptable.
We would have spent trillions and trillions of dollars.
We would have had to close up, I think, at least 25% to 30% of our businesses.
Who the hell would make a deal like that, right?
Who would make a deal like that?
No, how unfair.
You look at Russia.
You look at China.
You look at India.
They all got these massive breaks.
We got no breaks, and we're paying money.
I say sometimes to France, "How are the yellow vests working out?"
Because they don't like raising their taxes and sending the money to faraway places that they'd never heard of.
So, we are in good shape.
It took a certain amount of courage to do that.
I said I'm going to get killed on this one, and you know what?
I did it, and I was applauded, because the people get it.
The people know what we're doing, and they're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world.
They're tired of being ripped off by the rest of the world.
… I immediately canceled the Obama administration's job-killing catastrophe, which would have dealt a death blow to the United States auto industry, the Transpacific Partnership.
It was a disaster.
That was going to be worse than NAFTA.
NAFTA, I always say, the world's worst deal.
I think that would have been worse.
It would have taken the car industry.
It would have taken many of your industries.
That was a setup for the United States to get fleeced.
… That's going to include, because we take care of our great auto workers of Toledo, the home of Jeep.
How good is Jeep?
I've taken the toughest-ever action against China's chronic trade abuses, including tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese made goods, bringing billions and billions of dollars into our treasury.
I gave some of that money, because they were targeted, to our farmers, and our farmers did just fine.
Now, the deal is done, and the other deals are done, and the farmers are doing very well.
We love our farmers, and they never complain.
They never complain.
You know, when they'd go, the fake news back there, they'd go and they'd talk- And when they come, the fake news back, they go and talk to the farmers.
"What do you think of President Trump?
China is deciding not to buy anymore of this."
You know what the farmers would say, "We're going to have to suffer for a while because there's China and there's other nations have been ripping us off for years.
The President is right and we're with the President."
How great?
How great?
But our strong action paid off and we'll sign that terrific and fully enforceable Phase One trade deal with China.
And again, we're keeping the tariffs on because we use that for other money.
We are taking billions.
Remember what I said?
We're not paying for it.
Because China devalued their currency and then they put a lot of money into the pot.
We're not paying for it.
And now they're starting to say, "I guess he was right."
And our trade deficit, as a result, has come, has really come substantially down.
It was just in the papers today.
The trade deficit has come down.
As a result of our actions, steel mills all across Ohio, you know this better than I do, are roaring back to life!
JSW Steel is investing five hundred million dollars in Acero Junction.
Republic Steel is reopening the Loraine Mill that they idled in 2016.
Charter Steel is building a 150 million dollar mill in Cuyahoga Heights and Nucor is investing 85 million dollars at a facility in Marion, Ohio.
Think of that.
I think you do.
The steel industry was dead and now it's vibrant.
All told, American steel companies are currently making 13 billion dollars worth of new investments all across our nation.
Think of that.
They weren't investing 25 cents.
The industry was dead.
Now it's vibrant.
After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation.
We are finally putting America first!
But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Washington Democrats are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts.
Think of it.
The day they came down that escalator it started.
Who the hell else could they take in this stuff?
Right?
Can I get some credit for that?
Most guys would have been in a corner with their thumb in their mouth saying, "Mommy, Mommy, take me home."
These are bad people.
The Democrat politicians we're fighting today are the same ones who took a sledgehammer to Ohio jobs in factories.
They destroyed your factories.
They destroyed your jobs.
But they're losing and we're winning and America's comeback continues full speed ahead.
On no issue have Democrat politicians more clearly betrayed the American people than the issue of illegal immigration.
Far left radical politicians support deadly sanctuary cities and demonstrated their contempt, scorn, and disdain for everyday Americans and the American family.
These jurisdictions release dangerous violent criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack, and kill American citizens but stop it.
They want open borders.
Can you believe it?
And because of Democrats' open border policies, they want open borders.
They want more people flowing.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Innocent Americans are being brutalized and murdered by illegal alien criminals.
As just one example right here in Ohio, you all know about it, an illegal alien went on a deadly crime spree, attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl.
Then raping an murdering a 60-year old woman.
Then shooting at a woman who took a shortcut through the park and was walking with her children.
And finally the police came.
We love our police.
And they were able to apprehend this terrible criminal.
Thanks to Democrat policies, MS-13 gang members… they're the worst… were allowed to infiltrate the country.
You know I called them animals and Nancy Pelosi said, "They're not animals.
They're human beings."
Take a look at what's happened to her district.
Her district is one of the most disgusting dirty… it used to be one of the best in the country.
Now it's a disgrace what's happened.
Drug dealings all over the place.
The homeless they're not taking care of.
Tents down major thoroughfares.
What happened in San Francisco, in particular her district, and she lives in this beautiful house.
But they turn all these arsonists out, including killing their victims with machetes, MS-13.
They kill them with machetes.
You know why?
Because it's more painful than using a gun.
Federal authorities recently discovered and rounded up more than 25 MS-13 gang members in Central Ohio.
And they will be sent to jail or frankly, I they hold them… I don't know that they can hold them.
They're going to be sent the hell back home.
Last year alone, ICE officers, who by the way are heroes.
These are brave people.
I don't want to do it.
You don't want to do it.
Let's see, you can do it.
You can do it.
You can do it.
Most of you wouldn't.
I mean, I've seen it.
They have these people that are like killers.
And now the guys are here.
And they want to call them a safe place.
And they run in and they're swinging and punching.
What the hell kind of a job is that?
That's what they do.
They're tough people.
They're great patriots.
Who the hell wants to do it?
They're incredible, ICE.
And they get scorned and we take out thousands and thousands of MS-13 members every single year.
They throw them in the back of the van and we get them the hell out of our country.
But ICE offices worked through Ohio police to remove one thousand two hundred dangerous criminal aliens from your streets.
And on all your street, do you see the difference now between what it is now?
We have a problem over there?
Go ahead.
Take your time.
Take your time.
Good, thank you.
Great job.
Thank you.
Okay these people here, unlike you up there, these people have been waiting for three days so that they could be here.
I don't know.
You know what?
If I had to wait three days, I think I'd like your seat better.
I like your seat.
But Democrats stand for crime, corruption, and chaos.
Republicans stand for law, order, and justice.
That's really the way it is.
We side with law enforcement, with law abiding Americans, not law breaking criminal aliens.
We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members from our country by the thousands.
We are sending them home.
And we will no let them back in.
And I have to tell you, a lot of things are happening.
You're going to hear about that in two seconds.
Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, illegal crossing are down 75% since May.
We have ended catch and release.
Catch and release, you know what catch and release is?
We catch them.
We take down their name and we release them.
What kind of crap is that?
These are the policies that we inherited.
You catch somebody, take their name.
Say "Please come back in three years."
Right?
And we're releasing them back to the community.
And if you don't do that everybody gets sued.
Can you believe this?
We have ended catch and release.
The other one, beauty, how about that lottery?
It's called VISA lottery.
How about this?
They put their hand… these people are going to America.
Bomb.
I will not use names because I'll be accused of something later.
But from Honduras, what about it?
El Salvador, we have… He's good.
Only in Ohio can that happen.
Who's the man that did that?
Who is that?
So anyway, but, in Honduras, Guatemala they have like this lottery.
Now the people, I've gotten to know the government officials.
They're good.
They've made some good things.
They said, "Hey we need to take our people back."
They're getting their people back.
Before, they wouldn't take them back.
They'd send them here to go into our county.
We'd bring them back under past administrations and then after that, they'd say, "We're not taking them back.
We're not taking them back.
Take them the hell our of here.
We're not letting you land your plane."
So we have the government flying the plane all over trying to get a couple prisoners, bad people back.
Now they take them back.
You know why?
Because we said, "Look, if you don't take them back, we're going to put tariffs on every single thing you sell."
Now they say, "We'd love to take them back.
We'd love to take them back.
We'll take them back gladly, sir."
No, they couldn't get them back.
We'd take off with these absolutely gang members an we'd bring them back and they wouldn't accept them.
We couldn't land the plane.
We couldn't get anything through the border.
It comes through the border this way, not that way.
But now they take them back.
They've been good actually.
They've been very good.
Now we paid them a lot of money.
We paid them 500 million dollars a year.
Can you believe we paid them 500 million through El Salvador?
And I said, "Oh, there's not going to be any money anymore because you're not treating us right."
And they've been good.
They've been great.
They take them back.
"How many would you like us to take?
We'll take as many as you want."
And here's the big thing.
Ready?
You ready?
Today in the newspapers in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals we won't the big big beautiful lawsuit when they were all suing us.
The wall is being built.
We built it.
We built already a tremendous amount.
But we're releasing four million dollars of military construction funds to build the biggest section of the wall.
It's literally being signed now and will be under construction very shortly in couple of weeks.
And we've already built over a 100 miles of wall.
How about that?
100 miles.
And by the end of next year, we're going to have a lo more built.
And it's already having a big impact.
How about that, Democrats?
"Walls don't work.
We want technology."
I said, "What do you want to do?"
They want drones.
Oh, good.
When people are rushing, the caravans, when they're rushing, having a drone flying around is not going to help you do it.
Okay?
Nothing like… you know five years ago, the Democrats all wanted a wall.
They just could never get I built.
They didn't know how the hell to build it.
I do.
So we built 100 miles.
I think probably more than that now.
We have a lot under contract.
But we won our big case just… I woke up.
They said, "Sir, we have good news.
They overturned a horrible decision from the lower court.
You can now fund the rest of the wall."
I said, "Thank you very much."
Thank you, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals have changed some.
They want crime.
They want gangs.
I'm saying all this stuff and then I say, "Gee, now I sort of understand why they hate me."
Right?
But it's true.
It's true.
Their policies are a disaster.
They're bad politicians and they're horrible policies but what they do is they stick together and then they're vicious.
They're vicious, horrible people.
I didn't say that.
They're horrible people.
What they do to people is as disgrace but they stick together left their party and joined our party.
But we've done things nobody's ever done before.
But the Democrats are taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders and that group.
Omar, AOC, Talib.
This is a jihadist woman, Talib.
Talib.
Boy, what a group but they're the leaders of the party.
They're really my opinion dealers.
That's what happened.
That's how they got into this impeachment on this.
The leaders of the party are… there's AOC, Talib, and Omar.
And Pelosi beats them but she shakes and quivers and she's very soft.
But you know who the leader of your party is?
All of you.
Thank you, thank you.
So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin.
Thank you, Oklahoma.
And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence.
We begin, we begin our campaign.
Thank you.
We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors.
I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative.
Don't go, don't come, don't do anything.
Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it.
I've never seen anything like it.
You are warriors, thank you.
We had some very bad people outside.
We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things.
But I really do, I appreciate it.
We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma.
And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word.
That's the word.
I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before.
Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden.
Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh?
We're going to stop the radical left.
We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed.
Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all.
We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order.
Think of what we've done.
We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record.
That's an all time record.
I've always heard how important judges are.
Now we know how important they are.
Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term.
And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number.
Very important, November 3rd.
And two great Supreme Court judges.
So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great.
They are, they're great.
We have two.
And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more.
We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military.
And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA.
We passed V.A.
Choice.
Thank you very much, Jim.
Where's my Senator?
Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great.
But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators.
You have two great senators.
So we passed V.A.
Choice.
So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done.
We get a lot of things done.
And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months.
What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill.
We take care of the bill.
We take care of the bill and you get immediate service.
It's never happened before.
And our approval rating at the V.A.
is now 91%, that's how good it is.
Never been anywhere near that number.
Never been anywhere near that number.
And V.A.
accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A.
People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people.
You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say.
And so you couldn't get it done.
That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed.
And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce.
V.A.
accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say?
We say, you're fired, get out, right?
Get out.
They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time.
Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp.
I never knew it was so deep.
But it's happening.
It's happening, I never knew it was so deep.
It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters.
Thank you.
We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share.
They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals.
That finally, finally, after all these years put America first.
I've been saying it for a long time.
We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country.
The Democrats want to raise your taxes.
Tell me about that.
Tell me about that.
I guess I'm old fashioned.
All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them.
If you could lower him, you couldn't lose.
The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes.
How do you figure that?
How do you figure that?
And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country.
And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma.
Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong?
He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho.
No, no, you're in Iowa.
He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio.
No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire.
That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet.
When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it.
You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster.
Right, right.
But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world.
And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together.
I called Russia.
Right, I called Russia.
I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico.
Mexico was a little bit tough.
That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus.
That's OPEC Plus plus.
And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again.
Almost $40 a barrel.
Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs.
So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt.
Now you think you're going to be hurt there.
You try putting AOC in judge of your energy.
That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy.
She has one problem, it's called petroleum.
No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration.
Not even close.
Nobody.
How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine.
And he's standing in front of a building saying, "things are very peaceful here."
And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen.
The whole town is burning.
It's like the biggest fire.
And he said, "Things are very good here, Anderson.
I think it's great.
These are wonderful people, Anderson."
Did you ever see that?
It looked like the world was coming to an end.
And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, "You got to get … you can't protect yourselves."
I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen.
And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.
And we did the same thing in other cities.
But how about Seattle?
Isn't that great?
So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle.
I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle.
Have you ever been to Seattle?
They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them.
And I'd have an offer out, I said, "Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less."
Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster.
I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second.
And I said to them, "Congressmen, what do you think?
I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in?
No, sir.
Let it simmer for a little while.
Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country."
But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices.
These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain.
They're incredible.
And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was.
And they never talk about COVID.
They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask.
You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in.
And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, "What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing."
But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19.
That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus.
And despite the fact that we … I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all.
I saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
We don't ever get even a mention.
Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening.
And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it.
We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible.
And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment.
And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword.
We've tested now 25 million people.
It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else.
Germany's done a lot.
South Korea has done a lot.
They called me, they said, the job you're doing … Here's the bad part.
When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases.
So I said to my people slow the testing down, please.
They test and they test.
We had tests and people don't know what's going on.
We got tests, we got another one over here.
The young man's 10-years-old.
He's got the sniffles.
He'll recover in about 15 minutes.
That's a case, add him to it.
That's okay.
That's a case.
I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right?
We know him?
Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing.
New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people.
He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18.
Would you believe that?
Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.
When you see a little kid running around say, "Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system?
How about a piece of your immune system?"
They don't even know about this.
Let's open the schools, please.
Open the schools.
Open the schools.
We got to get them open.
In the fall, we got to get them open.
The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments.
Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control.
We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually.
This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans.
They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place.
They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.
00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do.
And you call 911 and they say, "I'm sorry, this number's no longer working."
By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many.
Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping.
So what are you going to do, right?
So they want to defund.
They really do, this as a serious movement.
And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it.
In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay.
These people are stone cold crazy.
They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage.
We're a great country.
You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you.
People have come up to me, say, "How do you take it?"
I say, "Do I have a choice?
Do I have a choice?"
We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning.
And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event.
If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, "Oh, it's COVID."
It's this again.
By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history.
I can name, "Kung flu."
I can name, 19 different versions of names.
Many call it a virus, which it is.
Many call it a flu, what difference?
I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name.
But they say to me, "Where do you get the energy?"
I say, "I don't have a choice.
I don't have a choice."
It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it.
So last week they called me and they say, "Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready."
I said, "Oh, that's right.
I have to make the commencement speech at West Point."
Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, "Sir, we're ready to go."
I say, "Let's go."
This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting.
Actually, it's beautiful, very old.
Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there.
West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River.
But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy.
After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, "Sir, are you ready?
Yes, I am."
So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine.
We go onstage, which is fine.
They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time.
I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time.
The sun is pouring down on me, okay.
But they said to me before the speech, "Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet?
Or maybe there'll be in groups of two.
Would you like to salute?
Like this?
Yes."
Like this, almost 600 times.
You know what that is?
600 times.
Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right?
600 times.
So I did that.
Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech.
I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that.
Watch.
If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, "He exaggerated.
It was only an hour and 25 minutes.
He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar."
These people are sick, the fake news.
So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, "Thank goodness.
Thank you very much."
Think of it.
So essentially almost 600 times.
Now the general says, "Sir, are you ready?"
I said, "I'm ready General, where are we going now?"
You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there.
Now it's sort of late in the afternoon.
A lot of these fakers were with us.
So they know.
He said, " Sir, we can now leave the stage."
I said, "Great general, let's go, I'll follow you," and he goes like this, "Right here, sir," and I walked off.
The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long.
I say, "General."
Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing.
I love them, I love them.
They're incredible, and they do.
I said, "General, I've got myself a problem, general."
Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces.
It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them.
This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it.
This was a steel ramp.
It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, "General, I have a problem," and he didn't understand that at first.
I said, "There's no way."
He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times.
I just made a big speech.
I sat for other speeches.
I'm being baked.
I'm being baked like a cake.
I said, "General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General.
I have no railing."
It's true.
So I said, "Is there like something else around?"
"Sir, the ramp is ready to go."
"Grab me sir, grab me."
I didn't really want to grab him.
You know why?
Because I said, "That will be a story too."
So now I have a choice.
I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really … It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal.
So I said, "General, get ready because I may grab you so fast."
Because I can't fall with the fake news watching.
If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember?
I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays.
It's true, right?
"I don't want that, general."
Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes.
Then I looked at mine.
Very, very slippery.
So I end up saying, "Okay, general, let's go.
I will only grab you if I need you.
That's not a good story.
Falling would be a disaster.
It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp.
Right?
So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right?
I was really bent over too.
I didn't like that.
I didn't like this picture.
This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers.
So I was bent over, right?
Bent over like this.
Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off.
You know why?
Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, "General, I'm sorry," and I ran down the rest, right?
I looked very handsome.
That was the only good.
I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad.
So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look.
In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, "Here was the number one trending story."
I call my wife, I said, "How good was that speech?
I thought it was a …" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones.
Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun.
So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, "How good was it, darling?"
She said, "You're trending number one."
I said to our great first lady, I said, "Let me ask you a question.
Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one?
Because I felt it was really good."
No no, they don't even mention the speech.
They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease.
It's true.
It's true.
It's true.
They say there is something wrong with our president.
I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay?
I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.
So then my wife said, "Well it wasn't only the ramp.
Did you have water?"
I said, "Yeah.
I was speaking for a long time.
I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit."
You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you.
I love this location, the sun's like this.
This way they save on lighting, right?
That's why they did it probably.
So what happens is I said, "What does it have to do with water?"
They said, "You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water."
I said, "I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?"
She said, "Well I know what you did.
You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive."
It's silk because they look better.
They have a better sheen to them.
And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.
It's so unfair.
It really is.
So unfair.
They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth.
They're bad people.
Bad people.
Okay, that's enough of that.
I wanted to tell that story.
Does everybody understand that story?
The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson.
Now we're getting into the real stuff.
They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it.
They didn't have too much of a chance.
Those Italians, I love the Italians.
They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing.
They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they?
Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right?
Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire.
Democrat, all Democrat.
Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr.
Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year.
One year.
Jim and James.
Jim and James.
We ought to do it.
You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do.
We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens?
We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay?
In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors.
You listen to the fake news, they say, "Oh, the protesters were lovely."
Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle?
They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out.
Take it away.
Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want.
I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it.
I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back.
Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation.
Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob.
He has no control.
Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs?
You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister?
"Get me the hell out of there.
These people are crazy."
That's what he says.
He has absolutely no control.
You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't … It'll say, "A comment from Joe Biden," but he didn't say it.
Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it.
Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, "Joe didn't say that.
Joe doesn't even understand it."
wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old.
People don't realize that.
So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week?
"Sir, would you sign for this plane?"
Now it's actually two planes.
"Would you sign for this plane?
Air Force One?"
I said, "How old is the original or the one we have now?"
"Sir, it's 31, 32 years."
I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the … They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, "Wait a minute.
That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do …".
This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what?
On November 3 we're going to win.
We're going to win.
So they came in and they came in and they said, "No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was."
Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy.
Whatever, but it was a lot.
$5.6 billion.
Nope, got to have a three.
Got to have a three, call me up.
Nope, cancel the contract.
I said, "Cancel the contract.
I want it canceled."
I said, "General, can you cancel the contract?"
He said, "Yes sir, I'm very proud of it."
"Oh good.
Cancel it."
"Okay sir."
"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?"
"Yes sir.
We have a cancellation fee sir."
"How much is it, general?"
"$250 million."
I said, "What?"
"Sir, we made a good deal.
$250 million to kill."
"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million."
That's not good, right?
Look at these two guys, they're looking.
By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers.
So they said, "$250 million?"
Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, "Oh, he exaggerates."
I look at numbers all day long.
That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it.
$250 million cancellation fee, sir.
He was very proud of himself.
What a great … I say, "General.
Don't cancel.
Don't cancel.
Just tell them I don't want the planes.
Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general."
"Why sir?"
"Because I don't want to pay 250."
True.
You hear that Jim?
Jim Inhofe, he's great.
You hear that Jim?
You know that story.
He does a great job.
So here's what happened, the bottom line.
Boeing says, "No way, no way, no way."
The next week they say, "No way we're doing it."
The next week they said, "How about $5 billion?"
I said, "No way.
No way."
The next week they said, "$4.8."
I said, "Nope.
It's got to have a 3 at the front of it.
Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch?
Don't you understand?"
I turned out to be right.
Turned out to be right.
Nobody gets that.
Nope.
Got to have a three.
Next day, they come back, "$4.5 is our best offer."
"Nope.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.
Come back when you're ready."
A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.
That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven.
Nobody wants to talk about it.
Nobody wants to talk about it.
When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that.
When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example.
I mean I have a German heritage like some of you.
I said, "Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent.
For many years they're delinquent.
They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying.
They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number," and they say, "Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current.
I said, "No, Angela, please.
Don't say that Angela.
It's true.
You know who I'm talking about.
By the way, very nice woman.
Very good negotiator.
I said, "Angela, that's a long time," this was in 2019.
She said 2032.
I said, "No Angela, that's not working."
But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, "Well, what about the last 25 years?
All the money you owe us?"
Everybody forgot about that.
They forget about all the money that wasn't paid.
I said, "What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?"
So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops.
Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline.
So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country.
We're supposed to protect them.
Excuse me, how does that work?
And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James.
When they hear it, they get it.
A lot of people don't get it.
They get it.
We cannot continue to be ripped off.
We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it.
And that means that a lot of people don't want me here.
They don't want me.
There are a lot of people that don't want me.
They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people.
You know that, right?
It's called the military industrial complex.
When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard.
I said, "Get them in."
After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets.
And last night that had a little breakout.
Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television.
We're not happy.
That's going to be very expensive for DC.
They're always looking for money.
"We need more money.
We always need more money."
And then they don't do the proper job.
So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.
They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial.
Not going to happen.
Don't worry about it.
We have it surrounded with very strong people.
The choice in 220 is very simple.
Do you want to bow before the left wing mob?
Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans.
And explain this to the NFL.
I like the NFL.
I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago.
I said, "Where did that come from in the middle of the summer?
Nobody's even asking?"
We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag.
We will stand proud and we will stand tall.
I thought we won that battle with the NFL.
The stadiums were emptying out.
Did you see those stadiums?
It took them a long time to get you back.
A lot of people didn't like that.
A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much.
I've had people that I said, "These are super left liberals and they didn't like it."
Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church.
They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally.
They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes.
They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders.
They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well.
We have a record this month on the borders.
Nobody's coming in.
Very few people.
And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard.
Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help.
ICE, they're rough guys.
they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack.
They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members.
And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice.
They want us to negotiate.
They start swinging.
And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon.
They're great.
And these people want to get rid of ICE.
They get rid of murderers.
They get rid of rapists.
They get rid of the worst scum on earth.
And when I called them animals, I said, "They're animals."
And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman.
They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful.
Dead.
Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful.
It takes longer than shooting a gun.
They cut them up.
I said, "These are animals."
And Nancy Pelosi said, "These are human beings.
They're not animals."
If I lose an election over that, you know what?
This country is in big trouble.
They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members.
In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens.
And that's true.
In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to.
The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out.
We have to do this.
We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do.
You know what to do.
Got to keep the White House.
Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure.
He never did anything.
He was a Senator.
He was a Vice President.
He was before that something.
You know what's great?
President.
Trump was tough on this or he was tough.
They complained, never did anything about it.
He's been there for 43 years or 47 years.
He never did anything about it.
Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA.
He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.
Korea, I renegotiated the deal.
I took a horrible deal.
That was a Hillary Clinton special.
That was a Hillary Clinton special.
She said, "We have to make this deal with South Korea.
It's going to mean 250,000 jobs."
And she was right for South Korea, 250,000.
And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden.
That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country.
When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades.
They became like a rocket ship.
He voted for the war in Iraq.
He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens.
He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.
When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus.
And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia.
He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering.
And then he apologized a month later.
He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it.
And they didn't cover it.
They didn't cover it.
On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border.
He thought it was a terrible thing.
Remember, this was in January.
That's early, real, early, the end of January.
He thought it was a terrible thing.
When we close the border.
Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.
When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left.
He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that.
Joe Biden will always let you down.
That's been his history.
At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani.
We took them out.
Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani.
He was vehemently… We killed this number one, terrorist.
He didn't like it.
You know why he didn't like it?
Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well.
Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
He opposed it, you know that.
Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him.
He never made a correct foreign policy decision.
Biden is a puppet for China.
Son walked out with 1.5 billion.
I think it's a little bit… Allowing them to rip off America for many years.
Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars.
We give a lot of it to our farmers.
We have plenty leftover.
China is not exactly happy with me.
They pay us billions and billions of dollars.
And they targeted our great farmers.
And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers.
So they were even so they're okay.
Are you okay?
Come, Doctor, please.
Doctor.
Thank you.
These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location.
You take your time, darling, take your time.
Thank you very much.
Take your time.
Doctor, thank you, doctor.
Some people wait for four or five days.
That's incredible.
He never did anything against China, Joe Biden.
And that's why they desperately want him to win.
They want him to win so badly.
Iran wants him to win so badly.
Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal.
The best deal you've ever seen.
I've already made one with China, but I can make even more.
They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose.
Iran.
President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.
I told them.
And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month.
And he was jobless.
Give me a break.
$83,000 a month.
More than anybody.
If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life.
You know that.
They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them.
Look what happens when you disagree.
You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it.
They call you a racist.
They call you a horrible person.
They want to crush religious liberty.
They don't want religion.
Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.
They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there.
In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president.
They put him in charge of guns.
Lots of luck on your Second Amendment.
Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter.
Hopefully it won't matter.
No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment.
The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before.
And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.
And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution.
And you now see how important the Supreme Court is.
Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is.
Think how important it is.
And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right?
It's almost like we're a minority court.
The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else.
We'll lose everything.
The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten.
These are great people.
These are substantial people.
These are the elite.
By the way, you're the elite.
They're not the elite.
You're the elite.
Somebody two days ago said, "Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you."
I said, "Yeah, why do you call them the elite," I said, "why?"
"Well, they're not elite."
I look better than them.
Much more handsome.
Got better hair than they do.
I got nicer properties.
I got nicer houses.
I got nicer apartments.
I got nicer everything.
I ran for politics once, just once in my life.
And I became President of the United States.
And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time.
We won't even toy with them about three or four more times.
We won't.
We'll do it one more time.
We'll be two for two.
And our country will never, ever be stronger.
But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court.
And I'll choose only from that list.
A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which.
And I did it last time and people loved when I did it.
And I'll only pick from that list.
Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical.
They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people.
People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday.
We actually won because they basically said, "You won, but you have to come back and redo it."
It's almost like, "Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good."
But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you.
Everything's going to work out really good.
Everything's going to work out good.
It was a great, it was great.
I mean, would have been nice if we won.
And Everybody said, "Oh, you're going to win DACA.
You're going to win DACA.
That's easy.
You got to win DACA.
That's easy."
They all said it.
And they came back and they said, "We don't like what you did with your paperwork," essentially.
So we're re-filing it.
Most people would say we lost.
We didn't lose.
We're going to refile it.
And everything is going to work out for the young people.
Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way.
But we're going to work it out for everybody.
Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party.
He is their pawn.
He doesn't even know where the hell he is.
Let's face it.
He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy.
Energy, you can forget petroleum.
How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free?
Not good, right?
Our country will have no energy.
Our country will have nothing.
Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business.
I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy.
And you know what that means.
She doesn't even want to win.
She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round.
You want to see a lot of birds that are dead?
Go under a windmill sometime.
She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials.
She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue.
You know it.
But she's in charge of the environment.
No airplanes.
We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it.
We talked about Boeing.
We could forget Boeing.
Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.
Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government.
They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country.
I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia.
No government, no safety, no police, no nothing.
Just anarchy.
And now she's telling us how to run our country.
No thank you.
And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it.
They've had it.
Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism.
When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap.
But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own.
He forgot to say he was born in America.
Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite.
Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral.
And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves.
Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met.
And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet.
America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden.
Sleepy Joe.
A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way.
If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything.
And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now.
Never been.
He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders.
Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages.
Those cages were built by Obama and Biden.
Look it up, 2014.
And the fake news doesn't wanted to… Remember the picture of the cage?
A cage for children.
Remember the picture of the cage.
And they said President Trump.
And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same… Built by Obama and Biden, the cages.
And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is.
They know the way it is.
They're not stupid.
They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all.
They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded.
They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen.
It'll destroy this country.
Our country will be destroyed.
We've all worked too hard.
They don't know what the hell they're doing.
Some do actually, but in a very sinister way.
Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted.
I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.
Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life.
We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders.
These are great people.
We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators.
They do a great job.
Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up.
Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington.
They're respected by everybody.
They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax.
I will say this.
Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe.
He's running on November 3rd.
I don't even know.
Does he… Hey, James?
Does he have any competition?
Is somebody actually running against… There's no competition that he's got.
I know he's got James' support.
He's got my support.
I give him 100% endorsement.
Jim Inhofe.
I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time.
Thank you.
Jim, great job.
Thank you very much.
What a great Senator he is.
Also here is a man who's respected by so many.
He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight.
Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas.
Thank you, Tom.
They like you people.
Thank you, Tom.
Great job you're doing.
We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know.
He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt.
Thank you both.
Thank you both for being here.
Thank you.
Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell.
Thanks, Matt.
Thanks, Matt.
And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole.
He's been here for a little while.
He's done an incredible job.
Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him.
I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to.
Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin.
The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan.
Elise Stefanik.
Lee Zeldin.
Tom Emmer.
Tom, thank you.
These are warriors, folks.
These are great warriors.
During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what.
There was nobody that could have done the job they've done.
That includes the Senate and the House.
These people are incredible.
David Kustoff.
David.
A great friend of mine.
Debbie Lesko, Arizona.
Great job, Debbie.
Great job.
And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence.
Thank you all.
Great job.
They're great… They are, they're warriors.
I'll tell you what.
Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them.
You'll send every one of them.
They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you.
And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot.
So thank you very much.
So we built the greatest single economy in the world.
And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me.
So I guess I'm right.
We did it.
We had the best numbers anybody's ever had.
We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history.
ell, thank you very much.
And hello, Tupelo.
This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi.
The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley.
But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country.
Right?
Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves.
Great guy.
Great guy.
Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before.
We're now an economic powerhouse.
We've never been in a position like it.
We've rebuilt our military and we have financial strength.
And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high.
Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded.
That's not bad.
That's not bad when you're on the debate stage and you say, "We have the best economy we've ever had.
We have the best military we've ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we've ever had."
Said, "Got the best president we've ever had."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Four more years!
Thank you very much.
And very importantly, we've confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written.
In a very short while, we'll have 182 federal judges.
President Obama left us 142.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, President Obama.
He left us 142 openings.
Can you believe that?
You're supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn't work out too well.
And just days ago, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice.
We have great military.
It was very, very depleted.
When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain't depleted anymore.
Yep.
al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you've heard about it for a long time.
I kept saying, "Where is al-Baghdadi?
That's the one I want.
Where is he?"
And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two.
I don't know if you read about that.
But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he's dead.
And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over.
American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say.
He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up.
No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you.
And our military loves Mississippi.
America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again.
It's about time.
But while we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane.
The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize.
We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way.
It will be easy.
From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh.
It's too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn't, they wouldn't be here.
Look at how many.
It's like the Academy Awards before it failed.
Right?
And you know why it failed?
Because they disrespected us.
But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary.
You see what's going on.
First, they engineered the Russia hoax.
That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people.
Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended.
With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let's go get him.
That didn't work out too well, did it?
That fizzled.
And a lot of bad people along the way.
And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi- … and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty.
And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt.
This is one I never thought I'd be involved in.
The word impeachment… To me, it's a dirty word, not a good word.
Totally phony deal.
They know it.
Everybody knows it, and that's why we've never had greater support than we have right now.
It's true.
And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside.
You'll see a lot more people trying to get in.
So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out.
Anybody want to leave?
Because there really is.
There's no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi.
We could have done this one on Monday night.
I said, "Let's do Friday."
Right?
Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives.
They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won.
But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won.
19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, "The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun."
At least they gave us 19 minutes.
Yesterday's vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself.
But I'll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I've ever seen them, the most unified I've ever seen them.
Right?
The most unified I've ever seen them.
The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism.
The Democrats' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020.
Make no mistake.
They are coming after the Republican party and me because I'm fighting for you.
They don't like it.
This is different.
They've never had anything like this.
Well, they've never had an election like 2016 either, have they?
They never have.
They've never quite figured it out.
You're the man.
And they know they can't win, so let's try and impeach him.
How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right?
"You know, we got to impeach him because we can't beat him."
I don't think so.
Right?
I don't think so.
Al Green, he's another beauty.
The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us.
And it's not me, it's us.
It's all of us.
It's 63 million, but it's much more than 63 million.
Much more.
And right now, our numbers are higher than they've ever been before.
They've never been this high.
But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that's what we're doing, and that's what's taking up so much time.
We're draining the swamp in Washington.
Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying.
They actually spied on my campaign.
Can you believe it?
I mean, you know, they try and say, "Well, we were actually just checking things out.
Oh, that's wonderful."
The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying.
I guess they knew we were going to win, right?
But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed.
And remember this, that truth is a force of nature.
Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary's shocking and very many misdeeds.
33,000 emails.
33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter's wedding.
33.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
Lock her up.
She's a beauty.
How about last week?
Did you hear?
I don't know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing.
She's not an agent of Russia.
And Jill Stein, she's a greenie.
That's fine.
We love the environment, everybody in this room.
You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we've ever had, and yet we're number one in the world in energy, by far.
We took over.
But I don't know Jill Stein.
She ran last time.
I don't know, but I know she's not an agent of Russia.
And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, "They work for Russia, they're agents of…" I said, "You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement."
She made it about them.
Everybody laughed because of what we proved.
But I'll tell you what, these are very bad people.
These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them.
But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle.
I've just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn't have too much political experience.
I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business.
Just did one show.
It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success.
14 seasons.
And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over.
It didn't do too well.
It was dead.
It was dead from the first episode.
I saw him, I said, "Oh, it's terrible.
What have they done to this beautiful show?"
Arnold?
But think of it.
I've just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty.
And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right?
He was all over the place.
It's the only time I've actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump.
True.
True.
Remember he said… Remember he said, "He will not be president"?
Well, that didn't work out so well.
And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking.
And we are kicking their ass.
I'll tell you.
In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I'm now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe.
I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries.
Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president.
But we've now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe.
Very slow.
He's gotten slower and slower.
I'm afraid if he gets a nomination, he'll be so slow we'll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary.
In fact, I don't even think that Sleepy Joe will get it.
But many people are running.
So, you know, it's so early.
I don't want to talk about their campaign.
Oh, did you hear Beto?
Beto?
Did you hear Beto?
Beto.
Oh, that poor bastard.
Well, poor, pathetic guy.
He was pathetic.
Remember the arms a-flailing?
Remember that?
You know, he ran against Ted Cruz.
Ted Cruz won.
He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good.
But I used to watch him.
Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables.
He was standing on countertops.
I said, "Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?"
But he's waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, "What the hell is he doing?
What is he on?"
And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this?
Anybody that says he was born for this, they're in trouble.
I used to have guys come into my office, "Sir, I'm the greatest salesman.
Nobody can sell…" You know, the truth is anybody that says they're a great salesman, usually they're not a very good salesman.
It's true.
It's those sneaky ones in the back that don't talk, that you don't know about.
They're the ones.
But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven.
He came down.
And if that's the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself.
And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas.
He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be.
So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don't work well in the state of Texas.
Right?
He was against religion.
He was against you having a gun.
And he was against oil.
So you come from Texas, you don't like religion, you don't like oil, and you don't have guns.
I don't know.
That's not a good combination in the state of Texas.
That's not good in Mississippi, either.
I don't know it's that good anywhere.
Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won't be hearing about him for a long time.
It's amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy.
But in the twist… Oh, Alabama.
Love Alabama.
I love Alabama.
I love Alabama.
It's a great place.
But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, "Well, let's see.
I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden.
How do I beat him?
How do I beat him?
How do I beat this guy?
He's such a great."
Clinton, she was easy.
Right?
Obama was easy.
The Bush dynasty was.
But sleepy Joe, I'm worried about, right?
So then I said to myself, "Gee, I guess there's only one way.
Let's call up Ukraine for help.
These people are sick.
These people are sick.
Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they'll put it, because they're so damn dishonest, and they'll just say- … "Let's use Ukraine for help."
That's what they're going to say.
And they won't show the laughter, and they won't show the sarcasm, and they won't show the fun because they're the most dishonorable people almost on earth.
It's a disgrace.
But we say it anyway.
And here's the good news.
The people get it.
So they have a brand new president in Ukraine.
Good guy, by the way.
And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I'm on a phone, right?
And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen.
And I'm on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, "Please, could you help me please?"
I don't know who he is.
I didn't know his name until I looked down the card, I see.
And he's a nice guy, and hopefully he's going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems.
And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption.
But the other reason… Why isn't Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren't they doing things that they're supposed to do?
Why is it always the United States?
So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect.
It was perfect.
It wasn't like almost… It was perfect.
It was totally appropriate.
I made it at the behest of people to say, "Could you call and say hello?"
Now I'm an honest person, anyway.
But do you think, when I'm making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line?
Many people.
Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people.
And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president.
I guarantee he's got a lot of people listening, too.
These people are sick.
no pressure.
They must think we're nuts, to be honest.
It's all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let's give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we've ever had.
So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don't quit.
But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe.
So I quote, "I said" … Let me act like him.
I've got to speak really slow though, and … "I said, ‘You're not getting a billion.'
I looked at them and I said, ‘I'm leaving in six hours.
If the prosecutor isn't fired, you're not getting the money.
You understand?
You're not getting the money.'"
Then he goes, at the end … I didn't know he had this kind of energy.
He goes, "Well, son of a bitch, he got fired."
You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn't think he had the energy, the brain power.
It's turned out he doesn't.
By the way, he's dropping like a rock.
When you're at 1%, there's always a reason.
He should be there fairly soon.
As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son's company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy.
He knew less about it than this young … How old are you?
Six.
This young, beautiful person in front of me.
Six.
And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I'd basically go with her.
So what is it all about?
It's called a payoff, but you know what?
The fake news, they apologize.
I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper.
Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo.
You've got Fredo and … That's Cuomo, Fredo.
I call him Fredo, like from the movie.
Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden.
The good news is Biden didn't know too much about what the hell he was talking about.
Remember Biden said, "I don't know these people.
I don't know them.
I don't know them."
we're dealing with life, right?
He never spoke to him.
Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That's why I like Beto, he wasn't smart, couldn't handle it.
I told my wife, I said, "See, it's not so easy."
I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love.
They love her.
When Beto quit, he quit like a dog.
When he quit I said, "See, people think this is easy.
This isn't easy," but it just worked out that way.
But Biden said, "I never met the people, never met the gentlemen."
Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they're playing golf together, but he never met him.
So now you'll ask him, he'll say, "No, we played around a golf.
We were together for three hours.
I never mentioned the fact that they're paying my son millions."
Oh, no, no, no.
… Well, they might be watching us.
I guess they do watch us.
He used to interview me.
He was so nice.
Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me.
It was like they were love fests, but I don't want anything to do with him.
They were love fests.
What a thought.
He's weak.
He's a weak person, but they're all weak.
But let me just tell you something.
We need honesty with our media.
We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don't know, you probably read it.
We threw them out at the White House.
We don't show them anymore.
If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out.
And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy.
Where's Hunter?
Where's Hunter?
We had a tee shirt made, "Where's Hunter?
Where's Hunter?"
Poor Hunter.
He then came out, he did the Morning Show.
That was the last we've seen of Hunter.
That wasn't good.
The morning of his father's very bad debate, but it's, where is Hunter?
But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times.
We got rid of them, right?
We don't have them in the White House.
I said, "No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don't" … We used to have them stacked up, and I'd go in and I'd see a meeting with my people and they're dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody.
And I'd go into these offices; I'd see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times.
I keep trying to figure out who's worse.
And one day it's the Times, one day it's the Post.
It's like top each other, they're so bad.
It's so phony.
In my opinion, it's virtually corrupt.
I've never seen it.
You never have a good story.
I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric.
Where did that come from?
The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look.
This guy built ISIS.
The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio.
That's a big, lot of land.
7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits.
I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy?
But they were so thrilled that we got this animal.
They were so thrilled.
But you know what?
And you know what?
We don't do it for … We do it because it's right.
That story was a massive story.
That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever.
Bigger than anything.
That story disappeared so fast.
Done.
And that's okay.
I didn't do it for the story.
I did it because it's the right thing to do.
But if I were a Democrat, they'd be talking about that story for weeks.
With me, they don't even want to … They actually played it down.
And actually, and I'm happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me.
And I'm very happy with that.
I'm very … Conan is incredible.
And Conan's coming to the White House in a few weeks.
But it is true.
Did you ever see a story disappear so fast?
I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months.
They'd be talking about his bravery.
Oh, so bravery.
But again, 142 judges he gave us.
Remember that.
How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges.
We got two Supreme Courts.
Great ones.
Great judge.
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges.
By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh?
Did anybody ever?
Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with?
Anyway, just to finish.
So Hunter then goes to China.
Now I'm dealing with China right now.
They don't like me too much.
They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this?
You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can't get it.
He walks out with $1.5 billion.
And then there are other places also, I understand.
Folks, it's disgraceful that the press doesn't cover it for what it is.
It's a payoff.
It's a payoff.
And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal?
They are not liking me.
They had the worst year that they've had in 57 years.
Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars.
We're taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we're doing with some of it?
Just a small portion, but 100%, they're taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers.
So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing.
And they thought our farmers would say, "Oh, we don't like Trump."
They did just the opposite.
They said, "We know he's doing the right thing because we've been ripped off for so many years."
But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, "Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?"
He said, "Sir, $16 billion."
I said, "Good, I'll make it up."
And we're going to have a lot leftover.
So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents.
They only took.
They only took.
So when I said to the farmers, "We're going to send you $16 billion, and it's already been sent.
And it's been split into $12 billion the year before."
I mean, think of that, $28 billion.
I said, "Compliments of China."
And we had a lot left over.
Not bad, right?
Not bad.
You think Obama would do that?
I don't think so.
You think Hillary would do that?
I don't think so.
You think Sleepy Joe would do that?
I don't think so.
He wouldn't know what you're talking about.
On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message.
It's very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst.
But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption.
They're corrupt.
Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician.
You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, "Oh, I'm going to sue him."
They said, "Sir, I'm sorry.
You can't."
He's got total immunity because he made it in Congress.
Can you believe this?
But here's the good news.
At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what's going on.
A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right?
Republican governor, right?
Hey, he's a great guy, too.
And all I know is he's loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work.
Phil is so confident.
I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something.
I've tried to get him, but some guys are confident.
Phil said, "No sir, I've been doing this all my life.
I love the people."
He built the most beautiful African-American museum.
Phil, he's the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he's got confidence.
And he said, "No sir, I'd been doing it.
I don't really want to do that."
In other words, he said, "That's enough."
… Oh, we love our police, right?
I love our police.
We love our police.
He'll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible.
They're terrible.
And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment.
So Tate's running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood.
Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama.
Isn't that nice?
He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win.
And that's not the kind of guy we need here.
Not in Mississippi.
He's supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp.
And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all.
They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey.
They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won.
We won, fairly easily.
But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote.
Do you believe this?
I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education.
They want to give them this.
They want to give them free healthcare.
They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country.
And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense.
If you don't want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute.
How's this guy?
I can't believe this is a competitive race.
It's embarrassing.
I'm talking to Mississippi.
I'm talking to Mississippi.
I can't believe it.
I don't think that he's going to be the right guy.
I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves.
He's going to be fantastic.
He will be a great, great governor.
Tate, come on up.
Tate.
Thank you, Tate.
Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate.
He'll never let you down.
And don't kid yourself.
Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him.
It's under attack.
So we're also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I've sort of said it a lot, but he's been a great governor and he loves your state.
He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant.
Where's Phil?
Come up, Phil.
Come up.
Oh, he's central casting.
Look at him.
Come here, Phil.
Thank you, Phil.
Thank you.
Thank you, my Phil.
What a job.
What a great job.
You have to continue that whole thing going forward.
So another man who's a warrior is a friend of mine.
Whenever there's a problem, he's there.
He's always there.
He'll be right at the front.
He is tough.
He is smart.
He's brilliant, actually.
And he loves this state and he loves you people.
Senator Roger Wicker.
Roger.
Thanks, Roger.
Thank you, Roger.
And somebody, I'll call her up because, believe it or not, she's running with me.
She just ran.
I said, "Cindy, you just ran.
You just won."
She said, "No, I have to do it again."
She's running in 2020.
I thought she'd have six years.
I said, "Cindy, it's only like a year."
Cindy Hyde-Smith.
She's incredible.
She's tough and smart and strong, and she's with us all the way.
Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Trent Kelly, Michael Guest.
Incredible people.
And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann.
Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch.
Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson.
Great people.
Your next State Treasure, David McRae.
State Auditor, Shad White.
Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson.
Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney.
And former governor, a man that nobody's ever heard of in this room, I'm sure, but the truth is he's a legend in politics and a great guy.
He's a great guy, Haley Barbour.
… Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election.
Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country.
Under my administration, we've already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak.
To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores.
What's happening?
You couldn't get the money.
The big companies, they couldn't get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint.
They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us.
All put to work.
We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy.
We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world.
For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals.
Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Two of the worst deals ever made by our country.
100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that's awful, and a big price to pay for Washington's disloyalty to the American worker.
That's what it was.
It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons.
But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am.
I'm a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity.
We're stopping China from ripping us off.
We're stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories.
That's not happening anymore.
It's reversed.
We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it.
We're replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable.
Nervous Nancy, she doesn't want to give the people of our country a victory.
She's very busy doing other things.
Having fun.
The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi's farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else.
It's a great agreement.
About time we got rid of NAFTA.
The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now.
The last administration's horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity.
Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs.
Blue Springs.
Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world.
We take care of other people.
We take care of other countries, but we don't take care of our own.
They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries.
They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money.
I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, "King, we're going to help you, but you've got to pay."
And he was great.
No, he was great.
He was great.
