"Goodbye , Goodbye !","Adieu , dispatch ."
Do not deny to him that you love me .,Don't let him know that you would love me .
"But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .","But a proper grace of an old age , Who , like pale , and newly washed With variable objects , and not base , and peas , in paying a place ."
Villain am I none .,"Fine , I am ."
